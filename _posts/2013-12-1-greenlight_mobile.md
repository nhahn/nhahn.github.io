title:  Greenlight - Mobile 
date:   2013-12-1 21:46:56
summary: As an additional part to the Greenlight project, I worked on creating a mobile component that would detect when you were in a room with the Greenlight system in it. Developed for Android, this application worked with a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon to detect if you were close to a Greelight-enabled room and alert you appropriately.
