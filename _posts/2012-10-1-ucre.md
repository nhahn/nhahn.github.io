title:  UCRE Contextual Design - (Re)Iterate
date:   2012-10-1 21:46:56
summary: For my User Centered Research and Evaluation class (UCRE), half of the semester was focused on a contextual design project. For this project, my team and I explored the idea of how we could improve the way students complete assignments. We developed the (Re)Iterate solution, an assignment portal that would allow for students to perform iterations on assignment and receive feedback from instructors and other students, all while tracking their various iterations.

Finally, we settled a solution dubbed (Re)Iterate. Iteration is the core of students’ work, but keeping track of it is not as easy as it should be. This solution attempted to improve this experience and process. This system tracks students’ experimentation process, allowing them to focus on more creative pursuits. Additionally, it provides clearer documentation of the iterative process to help students and evaluators.

The product will track substantive changes that students make during their iterative process, such that they can review and combine versions in novel ways. It can be used across disciplines. Additionally, it allows you to export your Action History for viewing by others and critique. 

For example, in this storyboard, a student wants to go back to see something they liked in their previous iteration:
<div class="row">
    <img class="th" src="/assets/img/ucre/storyboard_1.png">
</div>

These next two storyboards detail the interaction a student might have with their professor:

<div class="row">
    <img class="th" src="/assets/img/ucre/storyboard_2.png">
</div>
<div class="row">
    <img class="th" src="/assets/img/ucre/storyboard_3.png">
</div>
