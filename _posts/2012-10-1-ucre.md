title:  UCRE Contextual Design (Re)Iterate
date:   2012-10-1 21:46:56
summary: For my User Centered Research and Evaluation class (UCRE), half of the semester was focused on a contextual design project. For this project, my team and I explored the idea of how we could improve the way students complete assignments. We developed the (Re)Iterate solution, an assignment portal that would allow for students to perform iterations on assignment and recieve feedback from instructors and other students, all while tracking their various iterations.
