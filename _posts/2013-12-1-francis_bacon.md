title:  Six Degrees of Francis Bacon - Clustering
date:   2013-12-1 21:46:56
summary: As a part of my Six Degrees of Francis Bacon class, my group wanted to see if we could discern the attitudes towards contexually sensative words in particular time periods by using their n-gram frequencies. We used the K-Mediods algorithm to cluster similar words from the Google N-gram database.
