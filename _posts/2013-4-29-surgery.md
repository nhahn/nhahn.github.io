title:  Alternative ACL Fixation Device
date:   2013-4-29 21:46:56
summary: For my Surgery for Engineer's project, my team did an evaluation of the current techniques utilized for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) repair. After reviewing the fixation techniques, we determined that current devices lack the ability for surgeons to tension the graft after it has been fixed in place. Therefore, we developed TensiFix -a device that utilizes an interference screw to allow for post-fixation tensioning.
