summary: Greenlight is a system devised for my Information Systems capstone project. It harneses this idea of daylight harvesting -- ajusting artifical lighting in accordance with natural lighting -- wirelessly. By connecting together 3 components - a dimmer, a sensor, and a backend server - we created a system that had potential for saving up to 70% of lighting costs.
