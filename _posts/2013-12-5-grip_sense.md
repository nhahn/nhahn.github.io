title:  Grip it Good
date:   2013-12-5 21:46:56
summary: For my BME design capstone project, my team is working on designing a novel way to detect the grip force of patients in occupational therapy. We decided to select common, every-day objects and embed them with force sensors. This would increase the functionality and association of the measured grip force to the task being performed.

Current methods of measuring impaired grip strength and coordination do not correlate with the ability to perform functional tasks. For example, the grip force measured with a hand-held dynamometer is not representative of oneâ€™s ability to perform functional daily tasks. Other existing methods to measure grip force including pressure sensors, goniometers, sensor gloves, electromyography,and 3-dimensional imaging technology also lack correlation with functionality.
