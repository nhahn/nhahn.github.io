title:  Grip it Good
date:   2013-12-5 21:46:56
summary: For my BME design capstone project, my team is working on designing a novel way to detect the grip force of patients in occupational therapy. We decided to select common, every-day objects and embed them with force sensors. This would increase the functionality and association of the measured grip force to the task being performed.
