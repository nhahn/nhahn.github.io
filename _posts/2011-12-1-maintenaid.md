summary: This was an application created for maintenance workers for my Designing Human Centered Software class. We saw that most maintenance workers utilize paper systems to manage and organize work requests. To help improve workers' ability to coordinate and log requests, we performed a contextual inquiry to gather what features workers would want in a system. After gathering the requirements, we went through 3 prototyping stages, finally producing an Android app.
