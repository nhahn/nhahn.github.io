To make sense of these rich repositories of diverse opinions, users need to sift through a large number of items to learn common attributes, what the important features are, and determine how those match with their personal preferences. We introduce a novel system, SearchLens, which allows the user to build up “lenses” that enable them to evolve representations of their interests in a way that matches how their interests are instantiated in the data. SearchLens goes beyond previous approaches such as faceted browsing, user intent models, and personalized search by introducing the idea that each lens can match part of a users’ latent interests and concepts, and that these lenses can be composed together to match a user’s particular context (e.g., searching for restaurants with outdoor spaces and that serve alcohol and aren’t too crowded). Across a lab and field study we find that users find benefits in the SearchLens approach, including being able to transfer and reuse lenses across contexts, find and capture “honest signals” of their concepts in the data, transparency and explainability, and working at multiple levels of specificity and hierarchy."}]}],data:{quirksMode:!1}},frontmatter:{date:"April 02, 2018",tags:["Sensemaking","Information Retrieval"],title:"SearchLens"},fields:{slug:"/research/searchlens/",imgPath:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.3971291866028708,src:"/static/main-d7f36176351797ac443c7cbdde12da50-2fd78.png",srcSet:"/static/main-d7f36176351797ac443c7cbdde12da50-739b5.png 200w,\n/static/main-d7f36176351797ac443c7cbdde12da50-549e8.png 400w,\n/static/main-d7f36176351797ac443c7cbdde12da50-2fd78.png 800w,\n/static/main-d7f36176351797ac443c7cbdde12da50-c2444.png 1200w,\n/static/main-d7f36176351797ac443c7cbdde12da50-08c6a.png 1460w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/research/searchlens/",prev:{excerpt:"Abstract Online information is the modern tool of choice for individuals trying to learn and make decisions around complex subjects, but it is becoming increasingly challenging for them to make sense of it.

The complex and messy process of sensemaking requires users to constantly adjust the way they organize, perceive, and collect information as they learn from online sources. In this paper, we introduce Distil, a new tool for saving, annotating and organizing information collected from the web during sensemaking. Distil embraces the dynamic nature of the sensemaking process, allowing for users to adjust their behaviors and organization naturally as they collect and learn more about a topic. We utilize a user study to first inform the design of the Distil system, and then demonstrate through two scenarios the value of the Distil system. </p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/distil/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-05T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Sensemaking","Synthesis","Interaction Techniques","Annotation"],title:"Distil"},fields:{slug:"/research/distil/"}},next:{excerpt:"Abstract Whether planning a trip or researching medical symptoms, many complex and exploratory search tasks involve intense cross referencing of multiple sources.

One has to determine the popularity and trustworthiness of competing options and avoid missing valuable but less common options. Traditional search systems leave this task to users, while automatic result clustering approaches often fail to produce structures coherent enough to meet these needs. We introduce a novel approach that builds coherent topical landscapes from search results. By combining the rich but sparse representations of knowledge bases with word vector models that are shallow but dense in coverage, we produce structures more coherent than alternative approaches. We instantiate this in a prototype interactive system and explore which elements users find useful. Across three information seeking scenarios, we found that participants valued both the structure and distribution information provided by our system for complex exploratory searches and, surprisingly, simple searches as well. </p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/searchscape/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-01T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Sensemaking","Information Retrieval","Machine Learning"],title:"SearchScape"},fields:{slug:"/research/searchscape/"}}}}}});
