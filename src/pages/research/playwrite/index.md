summary: We've been working on the concept of "casual microtasking", or giving people small tasks to work on while they're doing other activities. In this paper, we explored this with Facebook -- we inserted small writing tasks into users' Facebook news feed, and gathered some responses about their experience with it.

###Abstract

Microtasks make it possible for people with limited time and context to contribute to a larger task. In this paper we explore casual microtasking, where microtasks are embedded into other primary activities so that they are available to be completed when convenient. We present a casual microtasking system that extracts writing microtasks from Word and inserts them into the userâ€™s Facebook feed. From a two-week deployment of the system with nine people, we observe that casual microtasking enabled participants to get things done during their breaks. The microtasks introduced a new interactive element into the Facebook experience that they tended to attend to only after first engaging with the social content. Participants were most likely to complete the writing microtasks during periods of the day associated with low focus, and sometimes opened Word after completing a few writing microtasks. These findings suggest casual microtasking can help people leverage spare micromoments to achieve meaningful micro-goals, and even encourage them to return to work.
