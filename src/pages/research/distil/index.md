###Abstract

Online information is the modern tool of choice for individuals trying to learn and make decisions around complex subjects, but it is becoming increasingly challenging for them to make sense of it. The complex and messy process of sensemaking requires users to constantly adjust the way they organize, perceive, and collect information as they learn from online sources. In this paper, we introduce Distil, a new tool for saving, annotating and organizing information collected from the web during sensemaking. Distil embraces the dynamic nature of the sensemaking process, allowing for users to adjust their behaviors and organization naturally as they collect and learn more about a topic. We utilize a user study to first inform the design of the Distil system, and then demonstrate through two scenarios the value of the Distil system.
