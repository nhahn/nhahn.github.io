One has to determine the popularity and trustworthiness of competing options and avoid missing valuable but less common options. Traditional search systems leave this task to users, while automatic result clustering approaches often fail to produce structures coherent enough to meet these needs. We introduce a novel approach that builds coherent topical landscapes from search results. By combining the rich but sparse representations of knowledge bases with word vector models that are shallow but dense in coverage, we produce structures more coherent than alternative approaches. We instantiate this in a prototype interactive system and explore which elements users find useful. Across three information seeking scenarios, we found that participants valued both the structure and distribution information provided by our system for complex exploratory searches and, surprisingly, simple searches as well.

To make sense of these rich repositories of diverse opinions, users need to sift through a large number of items to learn common attributes, what the important features are, and determine how those match with their personal preferences. We introduce a novel system, SearchLens, which allows the user to build up “lenses” that enable them to evolve representations of their interests in a way that matches how their interests are instantiated in the data. SearchLens goes beyond previous approaches such as faceted browsing, user intent models, and personalized search by introducing the idea that each lens can match part of a users’ latent interests and concepts, and that these lenses can be composed together to match a user’s particular context (e.g., searching for restaurants with outdoor spaces and that serve alcohol and aren’t too crowded). Across a lab and field study we find that users find benefits in the SearchLens approach, including being able to transfer and reuse lenses across contexts, find and capture “honest signals” of their concepts in the data, transparency and explainability, and working at multiple levels of specificity and hierarchy.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/searchlens/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-02T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Sensemaking","Information Retrieval"],title:"SearchLens"},fields:{slug:"/research/searchlens/"}},next:{excerpt:"Abstract Microtasks make it possible for people with limited time and context to contribute to a larger task.

In this paper we explore casual microtasking, where microtasks are embedded into other primary activities so that they are available to be completed when convenient. We present a casual microtasking system that extracts writing microtasks from Word and inserts them into the user’s Facebook feed. From a two-week deployment of the system with nine people, we observe that casual microtasking enabled participants to get things done during their breaks. The microtasks introduced a new interactive element into the Facebook experience that they tended to attend to only after first engaging with the social content. Participants were most likely to complete the writing microtasks during periods of the day associated with low focus, and sometimes opened Word after completing a few writing microtasks. These findings suggest casual microtasking can help people leverage spare micromoments to achieve meaningful micro-goals, and even encourage them to return to work.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/playwrite/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-03-31T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Mircotasks","Selfsourcing"],title:"Casual Microtasking"},fields:{slug:"/research/playwrite/"}}}}}});
