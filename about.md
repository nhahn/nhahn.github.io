Who am I?
=========

I am currently a senior in the Information Systems and Human Computer Interactions departments at Carnegie Mellon University. I like making computers help people by doing things they couldn't. This includes:

- Helping people work together from far away
- Leveraging how fast computers can process data
- Augmenting daily activities with computers
