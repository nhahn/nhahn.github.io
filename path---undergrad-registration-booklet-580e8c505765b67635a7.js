For example, the grip force measurement object for a cylindrical grip may have a similar shape, form factor, and color of a soda can, with force sensors around its outer surface. During testing, the patient will be asked to perform certain motions utilizing one of the objects, to test for his/her ability to perform similar tasks involving the same kind of grip force. In a test, the soda can-shaped object would be placed on a table while the patient, sitting in a chair in front of the object, would be asked to grasp it, retrieve it, and deliver it to himself as if he were to drink soda from a can.</p>\n<h5 id="data-acquisition"><a href="#data-acquisition" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Data Acquisition</h5>\n<p>While the test object is being handled by the patient, the embedded sensors will continuously register the force that is being applied.
