In this paper we explore casual microtasking, where microtasks are embedded into other primary activities so that they are available to be completed when convenient. We present a casual microtasking system that extracts writing microtasks from Word and inserts them into the user’s Facebook feed. From a two-week deployment of the system with nine people, we observe that casual microtasking enabled participants to get things done during their breaks. The microtasks introduced a new interactive element into the Facebook experience that they tended to attend to only after first engaging with the social content. Participants were most likely to complete the writing microtasks during periods of the day associated with low focus, and sometimes opened Word after completing a few writing microtasks. These findings suggest casual microtasking can help people leverage spare micromoments to achieve meaningful micro-goals, and even encourage them to return to work."}]}],data:{quirksMode:!1}},frontmatter:{date:"March 31, 2018",tags:["Mircotasks","Selfsourcing"],title:"Casual Microtasking"},fields:{slug:"/research/playwrite/",imgPath:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:2.0444839857651247,src:"/static/Overview-01-b2d1f537f16bdfe0c144bc2850ad1b00-2fd78.png",srcSet:"/static/Overview-01-b2d1f537f16bdfe0c144bc2850ad1b00-739b5.png 200w,\n/static/Overview-01-b2d1f537f16bdfe0c144bc2850ad1b00-549e8.png 400w,\n/static/Overview-01-b2d1f537f16bdfe0c144bc2850ad1b00-2fd78.png 800w,\n/static/Overview-01-b2d1f537f16bdfe0c144bc2850ad1b00-c93a7.png 1149w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/research/playwrite/",prev:{excerpt:"Abstract Whether planning a trip or researching medical symptoms, many complex and exploratory search tasks involve intense cross referencing of multiple sources.

One has to determine the popularity and trustworthiness of competing options and avoid missing valuable but less common options. Traditional search systems leave this task to users, while automatic result clustering approaches often fail to produce structures coherent enough to meet these needs. We introduce a novel approach that builds coherent topical landscapes from search results. By combining the rich but sparse representations of knowledge bases with word vector models that are shallow but dense in coverage, we produce structures more coherent than alternative approaches. We instantiate this in a prototype interactive system and explore which elements users find useful. Across three information seeking scenarios, we found that participants valued both the structure and distribution information provided by our system for complex exploratory searches and, surprisingly, simple searches as well. </p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/searchscape/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-01T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Sensemaking","Information Retrieval","Machine Learning"],title:"SearchScape"},fields:{slug:"/research/searchscape/"}},next:{excerpt:"Abstract Tabs have become integral to browsing the web yet have changed little since their introduction nearly 20 years ago.

In contrast, the internet has gone through dramatic changes, with tasks increasingly moving from the desktop to <em>the cloud</em>. In this paper, we investigate how tabs support the diverse functionalities of the modern web. Based on interviews and surveys, we found that many users struggle to manage and switch between streams of complex tasks, resulting in significant breakdowns. We discover competing pressures pushing for the opening of tabs (such as revisitation costs, sunk costs, uncertainty around relevance, and mismatches between the aspirational vs. actual self) versus pushing for closing tabs (such as limited attention and resources). Our results indicate these pressures lead to issues ranging from tab overload, hoarding obsolete tabs, frustration, and even shamefulness. Based on our findings, we develop implications for designing better ways for users to interact with the modern web.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/tabhoarders/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-03-30T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Sensemaking","Information Retrieval"],title:"TabHoarders"},fields:{slug:"/research/tabhoarders/"}}}}}});
