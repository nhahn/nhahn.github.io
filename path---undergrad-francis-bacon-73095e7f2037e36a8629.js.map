Like the analysis presented below, they are interested in examining the influence culture has on language.  They use a large corpus of book data that has been digitized as their primary source.

Our project, in comparison, centers around a particular event in history, looking for language change that may be related to that event.\\nIn our research, we turned to a fair amount of existing work that investigates the relationship of language to Marxism. In many of the studies we came across, social class became the primary concern, with a focus on the veiling effect of specific language. This is related to the expression of distinct ideas by a certain social class within a larger national language. An example is Valentinin Voloshiov’s “Marxism and the Philosophy of Language”, which deals with how ideologies shape language. Another reference point is “Marxist Linguistic Theory and Communist Practice: A Sociolinguistic Study” by Max K.

Therefore, a word was considered to be in the top 25,000 only if it was featured in a variety of writings.

Ideally, using this distance function allowed us to detect a larger selection of correlated words, rather than just those with a high euclidean similarity. Initially we were planning on utilizing K-means as our clustering method, however it did not end up performing well using Pearson’s correlation as a distance function.

This increase is the result of the tool outputting the raw data on the frequency of the words themselves, which will naturally increase over time.

Unfortunately, due to computational limitations, the relative frequencies would be too small analyze.

This being the case, it became an interesting question for us to consider what terms might be most revealing about the culture of this period. For instance, if we look at the word ‘industrial’, which does show up in the top 50 words of the Communist Manifesto, we see that its usage follows a similar change over time as the word ‘atheism’. While this could be significant, even obvious, let us also consider that ‘industrial’ clusters with such words as ‘accidents’, ‘blinds’, ‘successes’, and ‘villages’. Some of these clusters seem predictable, others seem to reveal more subtle connections, and still others seem arbitrary or difficult to draw meaning from.

However, this is perhaps too limited a time period, as we suspect that the linguistic impact of the manifesto might not be noticeable until much later than 1860.\\nOne possible implication of our study is that the impact of any single culturally significant literary work, be it the Communist Manifesto, The Wealth of Nations, or any other work, is far less immediate and apparent than what might be expected.

An interesting result that we noted during the examination of our data was that nouns tended to cluster with words that were more easily identifiable as being related by meaning.  Other parts of speech, like adjectives and adverbs, produced more scattered results.  Words that had both a noun form and an adjective form also did not produce very clear clusters.  For example, the word ‘individual’, which can be both a noun or a descriptive adjective, clustered with words that ranged from other adjectives (adequate, comprehensive), verbs (deducing, eject) and other nouns.  The nouns that clustered with individual (art, auxiliary, compulsion, fete, handmaid, individual, nicety, serpents, species, superstructure, sweets, uncertainty, veracity) ranged from concepts to tangible objects and, arguably, included more words related to ‘communal’ ideas than ‘individual’ ones. \"}]},{\"type\":\"element\",\"tagName\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Additionally, a closer examination of the words in each cluster could add depth to the analysis.  For example, it might be worthwhile to look at the positivity or negativity of the words that cluster together.  Coding words as negative or positive could give more insight into ideological change over time.  It might be the case that words with similar positive or negative connotations group together.  We noted that a large number of words that are traditionally perceived as negative appeared in the clusters of the ‘individualistic’ terms.  For example, the word “independent” clusters with “abandon”, “conflicting”, “confusion”, “danger”, “destroying”, and “difficulties”.  It should be noted that positive words also appear in the cluster, but to a lesser degree.

An example is Valentinin Voloshiov’s “Marxism and the Philosophy of Language”, which deals with how ideologies shape language.

While this could be significant, even obvious, let us also consider that ‘industrial’ clusters with such words as ‘accidents’, ‘blinds’, ‘successes’, and ‘villages’.

For example, the word ‘individual’, which can be both a noun or a descriptive adjective, clustered with words that ranged from other adjectives (adequate, comprehensive), verbs (deducing, eject) and other nouns.

We noted that a large number of words that are traditionally perceived as negative appeared in the clusters of the ‘individualistic’ terms.  For example, the word “independent” clusters with “abandon”, “conflicting”, “confusion”, “danger”, “destroying”, and “difficulties”.

It does this by connecting to our Ruby on Rails server through an API I created to pair with the Android application. After using a token for authentication, users can view information about a room, including power consumption and sensor graphs, as well as control the room’s lights. As an extra feature, the application can detect with a user is in a room by using a Bluetooth LE beacon. </p>\\n<img class=\\\"th\\\" src=\\\"./images/greenlight_mobile/Greenlight_Mobile.002.png\\\">\\n<div><a name=\\\"architecture\\\"></a></div>\\n<h3 data-magellan-destination=\\\"architecture\\\">Architecture</h3>\\n<img class=\\\"th\\\" src=\\\"./images/greenlight_mobile/Greenlight_Mobile.004.png\\\">\\n<p>The app utilizes two core components of the Android framework to manage its connection to the Ruby on Rails application.

This allows a user’s\\n<a href=\\\"/portfolio/greenlight.html\\\">Greenlight</a> account to appear in the general settings screen, and allow for background Bluetooth scanning preferences to be adjusted. </p>\\n<p>For actually transmitting and receiving data, a custom content provider and cursor were implemented. The content provider utilizes a local caching SQLite database to reduce requests to the database. The content provider accepts rails-esque queries - so you can send, for example: </p>\\n<p><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">where(&#39;id = 5&#39;).order_by(:updated_at)</code></p>\\n<p>Additionally the content provider allows you to follow rails associations, so most of the requeries are done for you. </p>\\n<div><a name=\\\"bluetooth\\\"></a></div>\\n<h3 data-magellan-destination=\\\"bluetooth\\\">Proximity Sensor</h3>\\n<img class=\\\"th\\\" src=\\\"./images/greenlight_mobile/Greenlight_Mobile.005.png\\\">\\n<p>The proximity detection portion of the application was created using a Bluetooth LE beacon.

On bootup of the phone, a background service is started that attaches to the library and scans for broadcasts in the background. Once a broadcast is received, the phone creates a notification, informing the user that a greenlight system is nearby, and when selected, takes them to the appropriate room screen within the application.</p>\\n<p>On average, the background scanning only reduced battery life by about 1 hour, and it is expected to improve with time. The low energy scanning implemented in Android is, at this point, only supposed to happen at discrete times, rather than constantly, however this constant scanning should hopefully become core in the future. </p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/undergrad/greenlight-mobile/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":2,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2013-12-01T21:46:56.000Z\",\"tags\":[\"undergraduate\",\"IS\",\"software\",\"Android\"],\"title\":\"Greenlight - Mobile\"},\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/undergrad/greenlight-mobile/\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/undergrad-francis-bacon.json\n// module id = 917\n// module chunks = 250246461946626"],"sourceRoot":""}
