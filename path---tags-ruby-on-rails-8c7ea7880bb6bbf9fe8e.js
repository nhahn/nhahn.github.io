To make sense of these rich repositories of diverse opinions, users need to sift through a large number of items to learn common attributes, what the important features are, and determine how those match with their personal preferences. We introduce a novel system, SearchLens, which allows the user to build up “lenses” that enable them to evolve representations of their interests in a way that matches how their interests are instantiated in the data. SearchLens goes beyond previous approaches such as faceted browsing, user intent models, and personalized search by introducing the idea that each lens can match part of a users’ latent interests and concepts, and that these lenses can be composed together to match a user’s particular context (e.g., searching for restaurants with outdoor spaces and that serve alcohol and aren’t too crowded). Across a lab and field study we find that users find benefits in the SearchLens approach, including being able to transfer and reuse lenses across contexts, find and capture “honest signals” of their concepts in the data, transparency and explainability, and working at multiple levels of specificity and hierarchy.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/searchlens/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-02T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Sensemaking","Information Retrieval"],title:"SearchLens"},fields:{slug:"/research/searchlens/"}},{excerpt:"Abstract Whether planning a trip or researching medical symptoms, many complex and exploratory search tasks involve intense cross referencing of multiple sources.

One has to determine the popularity and trustworthiness of competing options and avoid missing valuable but less common options. Traditional search systems leave this task to users, while automatic result clustering approaches often fail to produce structures coherent enough to meet these needs. We introduce a novel approach that builds coherent topical landscapes from search results. By combining the rich but sparse representations of knowledge bases with word vector models that are shallow but dense in coverage, we produce structures more coherent than alternative approaches. We instantiate this in a prototype interactive system and explore which elements users find useful. Across three information seeking scenarios, we found that participants valued both the structure and distribution information provided by our system for complex exploratory searches and, surprisingly, simple searches as well. </p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/searchscape/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-01T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Sensemaking","Information Retrieval","Machine Learning"],title:"SearchScape"},fields:{slug:"/research/searchscape/"}},{excerpt:"Abstract Tabs have become integral to browsing the web yet have changed little since their introduction nearly 20 years ago.

In contrast, the internet has gone through dramatic changes, with tasks increasingly moving from the desktop to <em>the cloud</em>. In this paper, we investigate how tabs support the diverse functionalities of the modern web. Based on interviews and surveys, we found that many users struggle to manage and switch between streams of complex tasks, resulting in significant breakdowns. We discover competing pressures pushing for the opening of tabs (such as revisitation costs, sunk costs, uncertainty around relevance, and mismatches between the aspirational vs. actual self) versus pushing for closing tabs (such as limited attention and resources). Our results indicate these pressures lead to issues ranging from tab overload, hoarding obsolete tabs, frustration, and even shamefulness. Based on our findings, we develop implications for designing better ways for users to interact with the modern web.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/tabhoarders/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-03-30T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Sensemaking","Information Retrieval"],title:"TabHoarders"},fields:{slug:"/research/tabhoarders/"}},{excerpt:"Abstract People engaged in complex searches such as planning a vacation or understanding their medical symptoms are often overwhelmed by opening and managing many tabs.

These challenges are exacerbated as search moves to smartphones and mobile devices where screen real-estate is limited and tasks are frequently suspended, resumed, and interleaved. Rather than continue to utilize tab-based browsing for complex search, we introduce a new way of browsing through a scaffolded interface. The list of search results serves as a mutable workspace, where a user can track progress on a specific information query. The search query serves as a gateway into this workspace, accessed through a task-subtask hierarchy. We instantiate this in the Bento mobile search system and investigate its effectiveness in three studies. We find converging evidence that users were able to make progress on their complex searching tasks with this structure, and find it more organized and easier to revisit. </p>\n<h3 id="website"><a href="#website" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Website</h3>\n<p>Get more details about the Bento project on <a href="http://bentobrowser.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">its website</a></p>\n<h3 id="app-store"><a href="#app-store" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>App Store</h3>\n<p>Download Bento on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bento-browser/id1101530325?ls=1&#x26;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iOS App Store</a></p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/bento/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2017-12-28T15:00:00.000Z",tags:["iOS","Sensemaking","Mobile Search"],title:"Bento Browser"},fields:{slug:"/research/bento/"}},{excerpt:"Abstract Crowdsourcing offers a powerful new paradigm for online work.

However, real world tasks are often interdependent, requiring a big picture view of the difference pieces involved. Existing crowdsourcing approaches that support such tasks — ranging from Wikipedia to flash teams — are bottlenecked by relying on a small number of individuals to maintain the big picture. In this paper, we explore the idea that a computational system can scaffold an emerging interdependent, big picture view entirely through the small contributions of individuals, each of whom sees only a part of the whole. To investigate the viability, strengths, and weaknesses of this approach we instantiate the idea in a prototype system for accomplishing distributed information synthesis and evaluate its output across a variety of topics.  We also contribute a set of design patterns that may be informative for other systems aimed at supporting big picture thinking in small pieces.</p>\n<h3 id="appendix"><a href="#appendix" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Appendix</h3>\n<p>Below is a list of the KA responses to the questions listed in the paper:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://turkwith.us/questions/102/answer/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">How do I unclog my bathtub drain?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://turkwith.us/questions/115/answer/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">How do I get my tomato plants to produce more tomatoes?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://turkwith.us/questions/153/answer/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What are the best attractions in LA if I have two little kids?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://turkwith.us/questions/116/answer/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What are the best day trips possible from Barcelona, Spain?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://turkwith.us/questions/177/answer/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">My Worcester CDi Boiler pressure is low.

To make sense of these rich repositories of diverse opinions, users need to sift through a large number of items to learn common attributes, what the important features are, and determine how those match with their personal preferences. We introduce a novel system, SearchLens, which allows the user to build up “lenses” that enable them to evolve representations of their interests in a way that matches how their interests are instantiated in the data. SearchLens goes beyond previous approaches such as faceted browsing, user intent models, and personalized search by introducing the idea that each lens can match part of a users’ latent interests and concepts, and that these lenses can be composed together to match a user’s particular context (e.g., searching for restaurants with outdoor spaces and that serve alcohol and aren’t too crowded). Across a lab and field study we find that users find benefits in the SearchLens approach, including being able to transfer and reuse lenses across contexts, find and capture “honest signals” of their concepts in the data, transparency and explainability, and working at multiple levels of specificity and hierarchy.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/searchlens/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-04-02T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Sensemaking","Information Retrieval"],title:"SearchLens"},fields:{slug:"/research/searchlens/"}},{excerpt:"Abstract Whether planning a trip or researching medical symptoms, many complex and exploratory search tasks involve intense cross referencing of multiple sources.

In contrast, the internet has gone through dramatic changes, with tasks increasingly moving from the desktop to <em>the cloud</em>. In this paper, we investigate how tabs support the diverse functionalities of the modern web. Based on interviews and surveys, we found that many users struggle to manage and switch between streams of complex tasks, resulting in significant breakdowns. We discover competing pressures pushing for the opening of tabs (such as revisitation costs, sunk costs, uncertainty around relevance, and mismatches between the aspirational vs. actual self) versus pushing for closing tabs (such as limited attention and resources). Our results indicate these pressures lead to issues ranging from tab overload, hoarding obsolete tabs, frustration, and even shamefulness. Based on our findings, we develop implications for designing better ways for users to interact with the modern web.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/tabhoarders/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2018-03-30T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["Sensemaking","Information Retrieval"],title:"TabHoarders"},fields:{slug:"/research/tabhoarders/"}}],"Machine Learning":[{excerpt:"Abstract Whether planning a trip or researching medical symptoms, many complex and exploratory search tasks involve intense cross referencing of multiple sources.

However, existing approaches have difficulties supporting the global context needed for workers to generate meaningful categories, and are costly because all items require human judgments. We introduce Alloy, a hybrid approach that combines the richness of human judgments with the power of machine algorithms. Alloy supports greater global context through a new sample and search crowd pattern which changes the crowd’s task from classifying a fixed subset of items to actively sampling and querying the entire dataset. It also improves efficiency through a two phase process in which crowds provide examples to help a machine cluster the head of the distribution, then classify low-confidence examples in the tail. To accomplish this, Alloy introduces a modular cast and gather approach which leverages a machine learning backbone to stitch together different types of judgment tasks.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/alloy/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2016-03-01T16:29:56.000Z",tags:["Crowdsourcing","Machine Learning"],title:"Alloy"},fields:{slug:"/research/alloy/"}}],Mircotasks:[{excerpt:"Abstract Microtasks make it possible for people with limited time and context to contribute to a larger task.

However, saving information is challenging on mobile devices, where the small screen and font sizes combined with the inaccuracy of finger based touch screens makes it time consuming and stressful for people to select and save text for future use. Furthermore, beyond the challenge of simply selecting a region of bounded text on a mobile device, in many learning and data exploration tasks the boundaries of what text may be relevant and useful later are themselves uncertain for the user. In contrast to previous approaches which focused on speeding up the selection process by making the identification of hard boundaries faster, we introduce the idea of intentionally supporting uncertain input in the context of saving information during complex reading and information exploration. We embody this idea in a system that uses force touch and fuzzy bounding boxes along with posthoc expandable context to support identifying and saving information in an intentionally uncertain way on mobile devices. In a two part user study we find that this approach reduced selection time and was preferred by participants over the default system text selection method.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/highlighting/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2016-04-03T18:00:00.000Z",tags:["iOS","Interaction Techniques","Annotation"],title:"Intentionally Uncertain Input"},fields:{slug:"/research/highlighting/"}}],"Mobile Search":[{excerpt:"Abstract People engaged in complex searches such as planning a vacation or understanding their medical symptoms are often overwhelmed by opening and managing many tabs.

However, existing approaches have difficulties supporting the global context needed for workers to generate meaningful categories, and are costly because all items require human judgments. We introduce Alloy, a hybrid approach that combines the richness of human judgments with the power of machine algorithms. Alloy supports greater global context through a new sample and search crowd pattern which changes the crowd’s task from classifying a fixed subset of items to actively sampling and querying the entire dataset. It also improves efficiency through a two phase process in which crowds provide examples to help a machine cluster the head of the distribution, then classify low-confidence examples in the tail. To accomplish this, Alloy introduces a modular cast and gather approach which leverages a machine learning backbone to stitch together different types of judgment tasks.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/alloy/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2016-03-01T16:29:56.000Z",tags:["Crowdsourcing","Machine Learning"],title:"Alloy"},fields:{slug:"/research/alloy/"}},{excerpt:"Abstract Crowdsourcing offers a powerful new paradigm for online work.

The Internet contains a wealth of information for learning the underlying structure of a domain, but relevant sources often have diverse structures and emphases, making it hard to discern what is widely considered essential knowledge vs. what is idiosyncratic. Crowdsourcing offers a potential solution because humans are skilled at evaluating high-level structure, but most crowd micro-tasks provide limited context and time. To address these challenges, we present Crowdlines, a system that uses crowdsourcing to help people synthesize diverse online information. Crowdworkers make connections across sources to produce a rich outline that surfaces diverse perspectives within important topics. We evaluate Crowdlines with two experiments. The first experiment shows that a high context, low structure interface helps crowdworkers perform faster, higher quality synthesis, while the second experiment shows that a tournament-style (parallelized) crowd workflow produces faster, higher quality, more diverse outlines than a linear (serial/iterative) workflow.</p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/research/crowdlines/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2015-07-28T15:00:00.000Z",tags:["Crowdsourcing","Categorization","Workflow"],title:"Crowdlines"},fields:{slug:"/research/crowdlines/"}}],"Ruby on Rails":[{excerpt:"Abstract Crowdsourcing offers a powerful new paradigm for online work.

In this paper, we explore the idea that a computational system can scaffold an emerging interdependent, big picture view entirely through the small contributions of individuals, each of whom sees only a part of the whole. To investigate the viability, strengths, and weaknesses of this approach we instantiate the idea in a prototype system for accomplishing distributed information synthesis and evaluate its output across a variety of topics.  We also contribute a set of design patterns that may be informative for other systems aimed at supporting big picture thinking in small pieces.</p>\n<h3 id="appendix"><a href="#appendix" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Appendix</h3>\n<p>Below is a list of the KA responses to the questions listed in the paper:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://turkwith.us/questions/102/answer/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">How do I unclog my bathtub drain?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://turkwith.us/questions/115/answer/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">How do I get my tomato plants to produce more tomatoes?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://turkwith.us/questions/153/answer/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What are the best attractions in LA if I have two little kids?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://turkwith.us/questions/116/answer/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What are the best day trips possible from Barcelona, Spain?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://turkwith.us/questions/177/answer/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">My Worcester CDi Boiler pressure is low.

For more than 60 years the organization has worked to protect central New Jersey’s water and environment through conservation, advocacy, science, and education. The new center will incorporate exhibits, classrooms, and a laboratory that focus on helping people to understand environmental issues and take the proper steps for a better future. The center’s many green systems, which include geothermal hvac, diurnal ducting, wetlands-based wastewater treatment, a green roof,\nsolar arrays, and more, will all serve to reduce the impact the center has on the environment. However, to fully achieve their mission statement, the association seeks to install an interactive exhibit that draws on data and educates visitors on sustainable building practices.</p>\n<p>Our goal for this project is to design an exhibit that can appeal to children, homeowners, contractors/building officials, and policy makers to enhance their understanding of human systems and encourage environmental sustainability in specific real-world contexts.</p>\n<div><a name="research"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="research">Research</h3>\n<p>In order to gain a basic understanding of how individual interact with museum exhibits, we spent several hours in a few museums noting the interactions and movements of individuals. We spent approximately 30 minutes in each of the exhibit spaces recording notable interactions and break-downs that users had with each particular exhibit. In order to capture the largest number of interactions, we split up into two teams and rotated between the different museums.</p>\n<div>From this research, we discovered numerous factors that influence a visitor’s museum journey from start to finish. The critical points to consider in this journey are the surprise or the event trigger, the interaction and knowledge acquired from such interaction and finally the transfer of such knowledge beyond the exhibit tour. In order to achieve this, we should create a novel and/or well- guided experience, facilitate collaboration between visitors, cater to the physical constraints of a visitor, understand what is important or unimportant to the visitor and last but not least provide a memorable experience that one can apply in context of the real world.\n<br/>\n<br/></div>\n<img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/museum_model.png">\nOur model that we used to explain an individual\'s exhibit experience.\n<div><a name="ideas"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="ideas">Ideation</h3>\n<p>We began brainstorming with an independent idea generation process. We sat in a room and, working alone, came up with as many exhibit ideas as possible in 15 minutes. There were no restrictions on scope, cost, or absurdity. At the conclusion of our time, we had a total of 40 concepts ranging from the very practical informational wall display to the slightly-less-conventional sculpture to simulate the water process through the movement of metal balls. </p>\n<p>The low-fi design that we settled on is a tabletop game to allow for the comparison of features and simulation of data. We envision a touch sensitive table top, upon which users move physical pieces representing each of the different features of the Environmental Center. Users would be able to pick up and move these pieces (like chess pieces), the goal being to move the correct physical pieces into the center of the table, where they would effectively be added to a digital representation of the building.</p>\n<p>Regarding gameplay, we wanted to give users tasks that would challenge them to learn about environmental features, and understand how they fit into an overall system. As a way to encourage deeper learning of the concepts, we wanted to be able to present different contexts for users to apply their knowledge. We also envisioned this as providing motivation for users to engage with the game, and to continue exploring content. For example, upon starting the game, users might be given the task to add features that would be relevant to a building in a desert environment. Users would then need to find out what features might be best suited in such an environment. They would be given the ability to see (through simulation) what the effectiveness and impact is of the features that they add.</p>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/tabletop_idea.png">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/energy_flow_idea.png">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/augmented_reality_idea.png">\n    </div>\n</div>\nSome concepts from ideation.\n<div><a name="product"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="product">Product</h3>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>The concept for the game is to have players build their own environmentally sustainable building while learning about the various features that go into it. Players can choose from a number of different features, such as solar panels, geothermal heating and cooling, and rain barrels, which can be incorporated into their building. The game also allows for players to change the size of their building and the environmental region it is located in. All of these variables impact the overall energy consumption and savings of a player’s building, so players are challenged to make informed decisions about the features they add. Furthermore, players are restricted by a budget that reflects real world costs, giving players incentive to weigh the up-front costs against long term benefits. At the end of the game, players are presented with a graph of their building’s projected energy consumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/info_screen.png"/>\n        <p>System Information</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/preference_screen.png"/>\n        <p>User Preferences</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>The game itself is both digital and physical. We use a touch screen as the game tabletop, which displays the interfaces, screens, animations, and content that players encounter. The player’s building is represented digitally and occupies the center of the screen. The game’s physical components are the environmental features, which are unique 3D printed pieces. We track the position of these 3D pieces using a camera positioned above the gameboard. A key mechanic of the game is that when a player moves a 3D piece onto the touch screen, that feature is added to the player’s building. To remove a feature, players simply take the corresponding 3D piece off of the touch screen. While a piece is on the screen, players can see important information about that feature, and click on surrounding icons to learn more.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>Customization is a component we would like to emphasize in our game, and we want to give players control over how their building ultimately turns out. We believe that this will add to the open-endedness of the game, making it more fun to play and replay, while also enhancing learning. Since our game is ultimately an educational one, our primary educational objective is to provide players with a general knowledge of environmentally sustainable practices. Our hope is that the knowledge and insights acquired within the game can transfer to real world situations for users.</p>\n        <p>In the following section, we revisit each iteration of the prototype and explain the process as we improve on and test with each version, from start to finish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/round_screen.png"/>\n        <p>Round Ending Screen</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div><a name="presentation"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="presentation">Presentation</h3>\n<iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/34585436" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/undergrad/eco-touch/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:5,frontmatter:{date:"2014-05-12T16:29:56.000Z",tags:["undergraduate","HCI","software","javascript"],title:"EcoTouch"},fields:{slug:"/undergrad/eco-touch/"}},{excerpt:"Background From the fall semester, in summary, we learned that: Grip force measurements from current devices, such as hand-held dynamometers, are poorly correlated with patients’ gripping performance during functional tasks, e.g. grabbing a can of…",html:'<h3 id="background"><a href="#background" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Background</h3>\n<p>From the fall semester, in summary, we learned that:</p>\n<p>Grip force measurements from current devices, such as hand-held dynamometers, are poorly correlated with patients’ gripping performance during functional tasks, e.g. grabbing a can of soda. These devices are unfamiliar to patients, can’t measure the five major types of grip, and lack the diagnostic resolution of a force distribution.

Through this guide, students will be able to successfully perform a variety of tasks, the broader of which are to browse through prospective courses, plan a course schedule, register for classes, and manage a wait list. The document also includes advanced tips that are not very well known, but which can make the process much easier to complete. To effectively fulfill the purpose, our document was written in such a way as to provide users with the appropriate amount of detail regarding the different steps in the process. It was also important for us to mention all the various sections and steps in the entire process, regardless of how minor they may seem, in order to ensure a wide and well covered scope. At the same time, our written content was supported by strong visuals that further helped students to understand and complete the different steps in the process. </p><h4 id="audience"><a href="#audience" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Audience</h4><p>The main audience of our document will be the new students of the CMU community, namely the Freshman, Graduate, or transfer students, who wish to learn how to complete the Registration process through SIO. These students, who are new to the university, will have no prior experience with the process, and will thus require the use of an efficient instruction manual or guide. On the other hand, our minor audience will be current Carnegie Mellon University students who have made a schedule on SIO before, but who need a refresher, or who wish to learn more about the advanced features. However, some of these students may not necessarily have much prior knowledge and experience with the process, especially the upperclassmen, as the process underwent a recent change. The minor audience will include rising Sophomores, Juniors, Seniors and Graduate students. </p><p>Due to the lack of prior knowledge and experience our main audience has with the process, our document was written in great detail, in order to ensure the users gain a full and thorough understanding of the document. Not only this, however, but the level of detail will act as a strong support to the completion of the process, and will remove the possibility of struggle from the process. This was strengthened through the incorporation of relevant visuals to the document. For the more difficult steps in the process, users will be able to refer to the visuals in order to gain a better understanding. Our document design choices also took into consideration the level of experience of both audiences. Our visuals were always positioned on either the left hand side of the page or below the text, and thus helped to develop a schema that the users could easily follow. Moreover, the close proximity between the visuals and the relevant steps helped to further facilitate the users understanding of the document. </p><p>The way in which we separated the document, into not only three major sections, but also several sub-sections within each one of the three, was suitable for both the main and minor target audiences. For the new CMU students (the main audience), the incorporation of major and sub sections will help them to better navigate through the document as they are completing the registration process. They could also easily return to relevant section within the document through the on-going registration process. For the current CMU students (the minor audience), the incorporation of these sections along with a detailed contents page will allow them to easily turn to the specific area that they need a refresher of. For example, a current student who is referring to the manual for the sole purpose of learning about the advanced features will be able to determine the relevant page number and turn to the relevant page through the use of the contents page. This will eliminate the need for the student to go through the document page by page until the relevant section is found. </p><h4 id="context"><a href="#context" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Context</h4><p>Our audience will use the document towards the end of the current semester, or before the start of the prospective semester, in order to complete the registration process as a whole. This document is intended to be used constantly and over an extended period, rather than at once or in one sitting. This is due to the nature of the registration process, which is one that is on-going. As a result, it is intended that the first section of the process, the Course Schedule Plan Instructions, to be used a reasonable amount of time prior to the date of registration. Once the course schedule planning is complete, the document will not be referred to until the day of registration. At that point in time, the second section, Registration Process Instructions, will be referred to. Once the registration process is complete, students may either immediately use the third section, Waitlist Process Instructions, if they have a need to, or will refer to it only when the time comes for them to confirm their waitlist courses. On the other hand, students who have not been waitlisted for any of their planned courses will not need to refer to the third section of the document at all. </p><p>Given the context, we have written and designed the document in such a way as to explicitly divide the three relevant stages of the registration process into three separate process instruction sections. This will allow the users to easily refer to the appropriate section for each appropriate stage, and to easily navigate through the document as a whole. </p><div><a name="strat"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="strat">Strategies</h3><h4 id="genre-based-choices"><a href="#genre-based-choices" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Genre-based Choices</h4><p>Procedural writing should follow a set of conventions and techniques that, when combined, will create an effective document that will be well understood by the end-users. For our document, we used the conventions and techniques mentioned within Graves and Graves ‘Writing how-to documents’ to create an effective and efficient instructional document. </p><p>It is extremely important to know and understand your target audience in order to effectively create a document that is tailored to their needs and level of experience, as can be understood through Graves and Graves. As mentioned earlier, the level of detail in our document, as well as the content and design choices, were all made in regards to the level of experience and knowledge of our audiences.\nAt the beginning of the document, we included an introduction that provided the users with an initial understanding of what to expect from the document. At the same time, the contents page allowed us to present not only the subdivision of the processes, but also acted as an overview of the content and of the included material. As a result, our users will be able to make a decision as to whether or not the document will satisfy their needs, as well as an understanding of what is to be covered. For our minor target audience, the introduction and the overview will help them to determine if the stage they are looking to refresh or learn about is present, and on which page it could be located. The subdivision of processes also helps both the main and minor audiences to easily navigate through, and come back to, the document at any point in time. At the same time, we were able to incorporate Markel’s ‘Designing Documents’ conventions. For the overview and the contents page, we included accessing tools that facilitate the navigation through the document. The use of numbers and colors allowed us to benefited both us and the audience, as we were able to better organize the document in such a way as to make it easier for the users to navigate.</p><p>We made sure to follow the convention of writing usable steps, wherein we wrote the steps in chronological order for both the major sections and the sub-sections and in the imperative. We also made sure to limit one action per step, so as to make the process smoother and easier for the user to follow. Both of these suggestions can be found within ‘Writing how-to documents’. At the same time, we followed Markel’s conventions, most prominently chunking and accessing tools. Through the use of chunking, we were able to group and organize relevant tasks within the various sections, a factor that also allowed us to more easily subdivide. Through this, we were also able to incorporate accessing tools, such as the use of headers and footers, that made the document more informative and descriptive.\t</p><p>Through the use of screenshots, we were able to easily illustrate the various steps in more detail, as was recommended by Graves and Graves. They acted as a support to the written text and helped the audience to gain a better understanding and grasp of the material. Following Markel’s conventions, these visuals were placed in close proximity to the text, and were aligned to the left hand side or to the bottom of the page.</p><p>Lastly, we conducted a usability test that allowed us to gain an understanding of how effective the document is, and the factors that need to be changed in order for it to be more effective for the target user group. Based on our observations and the observations of the user subjects, we were able to make the necessary changes to the document. </p><h4 id="audience-based-content"><a href="#audience-based-content" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Audience-Based Content</h4><p>Our audience is primarily based on students who wish to either learn how to use the SIO Course Schedule Planner or wish to refresh themselves on some of the features they might have forgotten. Since we do not know more about our audience then this general fact, it is important that we make a manual that appeals to all types of learners in the audience. </p><p>We decided to write very clear, and sometimes even incredibly obvious instructions, so that even a person who has horrible intuition when it comes to using SIO could follow our instructions and learn how to design a schedule. In our manual we tell our audience members the exact name of each button they must click, the approximate location of each button, and even include a picture of said button. We feel that this is the only way to ensure that our instructions do not appear vague to any audience member. The general instructions that come with SIO for how to design a schedule do not go into much detail, and thus can be quite unhelpful if a particular student needs very concrete instructions. We wanted our guide to stick out from previous Course Schedule Planner instructions, especially the ones located to the side of a sample schedule that are provided by SIO, and writing incredibly detailed instructions seemed to be the best way to do so.</p><p>We also wished our manual to include lots of visual instructions. In fact if a student simply follows the instructions outlined in our visuals, they could learn to use the Course Schedule Planner without reading the bulk of our written instructions. This is because many audience members might be visual learners, who prefer picture based instructions to written instructions. Students also get a better understand of the location of certain tabs, buttons, and drop-down menus from our visuals than they do from our written instructions. Thus our visuals really help to support our written text, as outlined in Horton &#x26; Horton’s “Picture Perfect Proposals”. Finally our visuals also help the text appear to be less dense and easier to read, and thus improve the overall readability and appeal of our manual. This is an application of Redish’s mixing modes technique. This is because our audience will be unlikely to use our document if it is more confusing than the currently existing instructions on SIO.  </p><h4 id="adaptation-strategies"><a href="#adaptation-strategies" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Adaptation Strategies</h4><p>A good manual provides an explicit schema for the tasks we wish for the audience to accomplish. We employed Smith and Goodman’s linear elaboration technique, as we had a very brief introduction in each section immediately followed by our instructions. We did this because we wanted our manual to be to the point. This is because our manual is primarily a reading to learn to do document. According to Redish these types of documents must be quick and serve an immediate purpose as the audience members want to get to the “doing” part as quickly as possible. We did not want a verbose introduction to each section as we felt the primary goal of our manual is to give the audience a short but incredibly detailed guide for using the Course Schedule Planner. We did not want the audience to waste any time reading a watered down version of our instructions before they got to our actual instructions. </p><p>We also wanted each set of instructions for a particular feature of the Course Schedule plan to be consistent to avoid confusing our audience. Thus each section had a small flowchart detailing what the section was going to talk about, a small written introduction, and a numbered list of action steps. Even though three different people worked on this manual we had all agreed to this general style beforehand, as we wanted the manual to read as if it had been written and designed by one collective mind instead of three disjoint minds. This was based on Redish’s principle of coherence and consistency. Also to aid with the readability of the document we used a consistent font style, used appropriate font changes to highlight section headings/information we wanted to stick out, and we also employed a serif typeface.</p><p>Finally we employed a table of contents in an attempt to help guide those looking for a specific piece of information to the right page in our manual. Since some of our audience members might only need a small refresher on a particular part of the Course Schedule Planner, we wanted our guide to be able to direct people to the appropriate pages without them having to skim through the entire document first. </p><div><a name="design"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="design">Design Choices</h3><p>The document was designed considering student’s context when registering or preparing to register. Generally, students are working at a desk with their laptop, either at home or some place on campus, when registering for classes. Therefore, they will be juggling one screen of information, their laptop, while also looking at the instruction booklet for registering. To accommodate this, as suggested by Graves and Graves, a smaller page size for the booklet was chosen. The 8.5x5.5” format provides this smaller, more manageable size, as well as a enough space for additional graphics that help to adapt the written information. Additionally, this format is both more easily distributed, and perceived as more of a helpful booklet, rather than an instruction manual. From CMU’s perspective, the booklet should be approachable by students and not appear to be a daunting instruction manual with regards to registration. This would make the registration process seem very complicated and something a student wouldn’t be able to do without assistance. </p><p>Looking inside the booklet, rather than considering pages to be individual entities, sections rely on the pages being viewed as a two-page spread. Individuals using the book will most likely have it lay flat on a desk for easy viewing, or on top of the keyboard of their laptop (which is well supported by the smaller height of the booklet). Instructions begin on the leftmost page, and the second, rightmost page either continues the instructions on it, with pictures being mixed in along the way, or it provides an overview graphic of the screen/task they are to be accomplishing. </p><p>A 3 column layout is used throughout the document, aside from the title page, which uses a 6 column layout. The 3 column layout allows for a variety of graphics, from entire screen shots, to small menu shots with accompanying text. Additionally, it creates room for the notations attached to the images. These notations add context to the images, essential for understanding their relationship to the written instructions. </p><p>The larger sections of the document are placed on the rightmost page of the spread, enabling a person who is quickly paging through the book to immediately find the section they are looking for without having to glance over to the back of the previous page. Additionally, this provides extra separation from previous sections, which helps to emphasize the difference between the various task sections. With the table of contents and the page numbers that are featured at the top of every page, browsing of the booklet is fairly efficient: individuals can use the page numbers to quickly find their position in the book, and then the individual sections are separated enough to stand out. </p></div>',

An analytical commentary on the problems inherent in social structures, with particular emphasis placed on capitalism, the manifesto was commissioned by the Communist Party and serves as the basis for the communist movement that grew out of the nineteenth century.  What followed was an ideological split between followers and proponents of individualistic social structure (capitalism) and more community-oriented social structures, like those proposed in communism.  </p><p>This ideological shift served as the basis for our project.  We wanted to examine whether the changes in political and social thought were borne out in the language and lexicon used in the time period surrounding the publication of “The Communist Manifesto”.  Several research questions were of particular interest to us: do words identified as ‘communal’ words have similar patterns of frequency over our given time period? Do the ‘individualistic’ words?  We also would like to compare some data specific to “The Communist Manifesto” to our general dataset.</p><p>We expected to see several trends in the data that we analyzed.  As the ideological shift we  focused on involved an emphasis on group-mentality and social organization, we expected to see an increase in the frequency of the usage of words that we identified as being ‘communal’.  As the population became more aware of the ideas presented within the manifesto and inherent in communism, there would logically be a greater usage of terms related to those ideas.  Conversely, we hypothesized that there might be a slight decrease in the frequency usage of more ‘individualistic’ terms.  We treated ‘communal’ and ‘individualistic’ as antonyms, and as such, predicted an increase in one to suggest a decrease in the other. Additionally, we expected to see a correlation between like terms, in regards to plurality;  we anticipated seeing clusters, based on the pattern of frequency over time, of words we deemed to be ‘communal’ and ‘individualistic’ </p><p>Our project was two-pronged in nature, with a digital component and a humanistic analysis.  As outlined below, we needed to construct a digital tool capable of clustering the data that was of interest.  The tool produced a computational analysis of our primary source of data, the google Ngram corpus.  The tool returned data on the frequency of words used over our time period, 1840-1860, and clusters words that have similar usage frequency.  This data was then looked at through a humanistic lens, where we provided sociocultural explanations for the data and explored the limitations and biases of our project.</p><div><a name="related"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="related">Related Work</h3><p>In 2012, Jean Twenge, M. Keith Campbell, and Brittany Gentile published an article that included two studies they conducted on the usage of individualistic and communal terms.  Their studies focused on a perceived increase in use of individual-centric words and phrases between 1960 and 2008.  Like the analysis presented below, they are interested in examining the influence culture has on language.  They use a large corpus of book data that has been digitized as their primary source. They eventually conclude that the increase in individualistic words and phrases demonstrates a cultural shift toward American individualism in the second half of the twentieth century.  This article, and Twenge et al.’s work have been criticized for failing to account for specific events that happen within the time period that might alter language change.  Our project, in comparison, centers around a particular event in history, looking for language change that may be related to that event.\nIn our research, we turned to a fair amount of existing work that investigates the relationship of language to Marxism. In many of the studies we came across, social class became the primary concern, with a focus on the veiling effect of specific language. This is related to the expression of distinct ideas by a certain social class within a larger national language. An example is Valentinin Voloshiov’s “Marxism and the Philosophy of Language”, which deals with how ideologies shape language. Another reference point is “Marxist Linguistic Theory and Communist Practice: A Sociolinguistic Study” by Max K. Adler, in which language is thought of as a product of society, and society as a product of language. If this is indeed the case, we would expect to see such forces at work within our Ngram data.</p><p>Another way that our research is distinct from existing work, is that we seek to quantify the changes that occur within language and ideologies after the publication of “The Communist Manifesto”. By tracking the rise or decline in particular language, we expect to make visible the linguistic trends that may coincide with historical events.</p><div><a name="method"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="method">Methodology</h3><p>Do to computational limitations, the tool was designed to output data relating to the top 25,000 most frequently used 1-grams in the general English corpus from 1840-1860. To do this, we filtered through the time-series information for all of the 1-grams in the corpus and sorted them by their maximum volume count. Therefore, a word was considered to be in the top 25,000 only if it was featured in a variety of writings. Unfortunately, we were unable to normalize words based on their relative frequency, due to the floating point limitation of the double data type e.g. the numbers were too small to compute. </p><p>After the preprocessing, we decided to utilize the K-medoids clustering algorithms to cluster words that have similar time series. For our K-medoids distance function, rather than using standard euclidean distance, we decided to use Pearson’s product correlation coefficient. Pearson’s correlation controls for different locations and scales of the two time series, which was useful to us so we could account for the base-usage of a word (the location), and the response a related word would have (the scale). Ideally, using this distance function allowed us to detect a larger selection of correlated words, rather than just those with a high euclidean similarity. Initially we were planning on utilizing K-means as our clustering method, however it did not end up performing well using Pearson’s correlation as a distance function. The cluster assignment and centroid update function did not end up converging, therefore the algorithm never truly ran correctly. K-medoids, which can handle arbitrary distance functions, ended up being a better fit for us.</p><p>We used the Java-ML implementation of the algorithm, due to its high regard in the community and its availability. We ran the algorithm 10 times, with a maximum of 1000 clusters for each run and at least 100 iterations of the algorithm. We took the 10 runs of the algorithm and calculated the sum of centroid similarities for each run. The run with the highest sum of similarities was then taken as the final set of clusters. The resulting set of clusters were exported and then used in a custom-made view. The view allows for an individual to search for a word, view the other words clustered with it, view the time-series for each word and view the average time-series of the individual time-series. </p><p>Following the production of the digital clustering tool, we input our lists of ‘individualistic’ and ‘communal’ words.  As a note, these word lists are primarily taken from a previous study on plurality performed by Twenge, Campbell, and Gentile in 2012.  Twenge’s study also focused on examining the distinction between plural and individualistic words and language’s relation to culture.  We used their word lists as the basis for our own, modifying them slightly to be more applicable to our specific project and time period of study.  In inputting the words, we were interested in which words the tool identified as belonging to the same cluster, as well as the frequency curve associated with each cluster.  The frequency curves can be produced by taking the numeric data that the tool outputs for each clustered word and inserting it into a basic Microsoft excel file and making a line chart.  Examples of frequency charts can be found in Appendix C.   The input words and the words they clustered with can be found in Appendix B.</p><p>We looked at Twenge’s study again when considering what methods might be potentially effective. For instance, Twenge made use of Mechanical Turk to have participants rate words on a scale from most ‘individualistic’ to most ‘communal’. Crowdsourcing can certainly be an effective tool for dealing with subtle or subjective questions. However, our system of clustering avoids such arbitrary rating systems and provides us with much more data driven results.</p><p>We also used Wheaton College’s online Lexos analysis tool to identify the top 50 words used in the Communist Manifesto. After removing common English stopwords, the resulting wordcloud served as a starting point for us to begin testing our clustering tool.</p><div><a name="results"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="results">Results</h3><p>We have represented our results visually in the appendices at the end of this paper.  The first appendix outlines the thirty words, fifteen ‘individualistic’ and fifteen ‘communal’, that would wanted to closely examine.  The second appendix consists of a table which displays each of the thirty words that we input into the clustering tool and the resulting cluster of words that the tool identified as having similar frequency patterns.  The third, and final, appendix has a sample of the line graphs associated with the selected words.<br>\nUpon closer analysis, several interesting results were apparent.  Of the fifteen ‘individualistic’ words that we identified in our word lists fourteen returned clusters; “Uniqueness” was not in the top 25,000 most frequent words in the Ngram data and did not return a cluster.  Of the fifteen ‘communal’ words, only eleven returned clusters; the inputs “communal”, “communitarian”, “socialism”, and “collectivism” did not return clusters.  Also, the average size of an ‘individualistic’ cluster was 65.286 words.  The average size of a ‘communal’ cluster was 46.545.  The averages were determined by summing up the total words in one of the two categories and dividing by the number of terms that output clusters.  (See Appendix B)</p><p>In terms of upward or downward tendencies, all of the graphs produced using the numerical data for each clustered word show an increase over time.  That is, the average line graph of each cluster increases over the time period.  We did not see any decreasing graphs.  (See Appendix C)</p><div><a name="discuss"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="discuss">Discussion</h3><p>The quantitative data that was output by the digital tool served as the basis for further analysis.  Below, we explore our research questions in relation to the data, discuss assumptions that we made in our project, outline biases of our project, and propose implications for future research. </p><p>Our hypothesis regarding the increase of plural term usage over the period from 1840-1860 was, in part, based on the assumption that words with similar meanings would have similar frequency graphs.  In using the clustering tool, we hoped to see these frequency clusters of semantically-related terms.  Specifically, we hoped to see ‘communal’ words clustered with other ‘communal’ words, indicating that they followed similar frequency patterns.  We expected the frequency patterns of such clusters to increase over the course of our chosen time period. Such a result would provide some support for our hypothesis that there was a shift in ideology, a move toward a more group-oriented frame of thought, that was evident in the lexicon.   </p><p>Our results however, did not display clusters that were as semantically-connected as we had predicted.  Some words did tend to cluster with like words, but many of our sample words produced clusters that were wide-ranging with no apparent semantic link (see appendix B).</p><p>With the knowledge that the graphs produced by inputting the numerical data about word frequencies into Excel covered more semantic territory than just ‘communal’ or ‘individualistic’ words, we still thought there might be value in looking at more general upward and downward trends across the data.  All of the graphs we produced from the data display an increase.  This increase is the result of the tool outputting the raw data on the frequency of the words themselves, which will naturally increase over time.  In order to actually look at the increase or decrease of specific words without interference, we would need to have relative frequencies for the terms.  Unfortunately, due to computational limitations, the relative frequencies would be too small analyze.  We would need to recompute the relative frequencies and graph those, and unfortunately we did not have time to do so. Therefore, we were unable to reach concrete conclusions about increase or decrease in our two categories. </p><p>In our effort to examine the direct influence of a single text, we also pulled out the most frequent words in The Communist Manifesto, in hopes of comparing their frequencies over the time period in question.  Unfortunately, many of the words that were used extensively in Marx’s text were not among the top 25,000 words identified in the Ngram data.  Words like ‘proletariat’ and ‘bourgeoisie’, that are integral to the manifesto and to the ideology underlying the text, are not present. Thus, we were unable to track the use of the words and their frequencies.  This suggests that these words were not largely in use in the time period we examined. </p><p>In fact, it may be the case that the Communist Manifesto simply was not as influential as we would have expected, given the emphasis modern society places on the text.  Our data suggests, though not empirically, that the manifesto’s impact on the overall lexicon from 1840-1860 was limited, if present at all.   We were not able to attribute any specific lexical change to the manifesto itself.  </p><p>While the scope of our project and results was not such that we can make any claims on whether the publication of The Communist Manifesto impacted the lexicon of the time period that we examined, we can explore other implications of the data.  As mentioned above, the Communist Manifesto uses highly specific language, meaning that many of its most crucial terms do not show up in the most common language of the time we investigated. This being the case, it became an interesting question for us to consider what terms might be most revealing about the culture of this period. For instance, if we look at the word ‘industrial’, which does show up in the top 50 words of the Communist Manifesto, we see that its usage follows a similar change over time as the word ‘atheism’. While this could be significant, even obvious, let us also consider that ‘industrial’ clusters with such words as ‘accidents’, ‘blinds’, ‘successes’, and ‘villages’. Some of these clusters seem predictable, others seem to reveal more subtle connections, and still others seem arbitrary or difficult to draw meaning from. For future work, perhaps additional methods can be implemented in order to aid in interpretation</p><p>A possible bias of our data comes from the fact that the English publication date of the Communist Manifesto (1950) is situated squarely within the time period we investigated (1840-1860). We chose this time frame because it allowed us to not only examine the forces at work leading up to the manifesto, but also those immediately following its publication. However, this is perhaps too limited a time period, as we suspect that the linguistic impact of the manifesto might not be noticeable until much later than 1860.\nOne possible implication of our study is that the impact of any single culturally significant literary work, be it the Communist Manifesto, The Wealth of Nations, or any other work, is far less immediate and apparent than what might be expected. Thus, it might be necessary to investigate linguistic data at a much larger scope.  </p><p>For example, looking at parts of speech might reveal even more.  An interesting result that we noted during the examination of our data was that nouns tended to cluster with words that were more easily identifiable as being related by meaning.  Other parts of speech, like adjectives and adverbs, produced more scattered results.  Words that had both a noun form and an adjective form also did not produce very clear clusters.  For example, the word ‘individual’, which can be both a noun or a descriptive adjective, clustered with words that ranged from other adjectives (adequate, comprehensive), verbs (deducing, eject) and other nouns.  The nouns that clustered with individual (art, auxiliary, compulsion, fete, handmaid, individual, nicety, serpents, species, superstructure, sweets, uncertainty, veracity) ranged from concepts to tangible objects and, arguably, included more words related to ‘communal’ ideas than ‘individual’ ones. </p><p>Additionally, a closer examination of the words in each cluster could add depth to the analysis.  For example, it might be worthwhile to look at the positivity or negativity of the words that cluster together.  Coding words as negative or positive could give more insight into ideological change over time.  It might be the case that words with similar positive or negative connotations group together.  We noted that a large number of words that are traditionally perceived as negative appeared in the clusters of the ‘individualistic’ terms.  For example, the word “independent” clusters with “abandon”, “conflicting”, “confusion”, “danger”, “destroying”, and “difficulties”.  It should be noted that positive words also appear in the cluster, but to a lesser degree.  Exploring this tendency in future research might lead to interesting conclusions. </p><p>Overall, this project resulted in the production of a digital tool that has wide-ranging applications.  While we discovered that its use in exploring a singular text, in this case “The Communist Manifesto”, as indicative of larger social context may not always be possible, it is at our disposal for future research.  Ideally, we could now apply this tool to a larger variety of questions with more concrete foundations and more correct parameters of interest. </p></div>',

Although it would seem that graft strength is the most indicative property for ACL reconstruction stability, it is actually the strength of the graft fixation to the bone. (Urbibe, Arango, Frank, and Kiebzak, 2013) Fixation gives the graft bone tunnel interface necessary stiffness and strength (Woo, et al. 2000). There are many different fixation devices available, such as interference screws, soft tissue washers, suture-post constructs, simple staples, cross-pins, and titanium buttons (Woo, et al., 2000). Since the graft selection depends on the circumstance of the patient, different fixation techniques must be used as well. The current gold standard for fixation is the interference screw against a bone plug (Brand, 2000). One study suggests the most stable knee reconstruction is when the interference screw is positioned close to the articular surface with central and distal fixation (Ishibashi, et al., 1997).\nFurthermore, the tibia position relative to the femur when the graft is fixed has a considerable effect on the kinematics of the knee and the in situ force of the new graft (Hoher, et al., 1999). Specifically, when the graft is fixed at 30o knee flexion, with a 67N posterior tibial load, the resulting knee kinematics is closest to the native knee (Hoher, et al., 1999).</p><h5 id="graft-tension"><a href="#graft-tension" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Graft Tension</h5><p>Joint kinematics and in situ forces of the graft while the knee moves are considerably altered by the initial tension of the graft (Woo, et al., 2000). If the initial graft tension is low, there necessary joint stability will not be provided (Woo, et al., 2000). Conversely, high initial graft tension would hinder joint motion (Woo, et al., 2000). The initial tension is suggested near 44N but this is controversial since the native ACL force is unknown (Woo, et al., 2000)</p><h5 id="problem"><a href="#problem" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Problem</h5><p>Currently, surgeons must rely on their own strength to add tension to the ACL graft prior to fixing the graft. Once the graft is fixed, there is no way to add more tension if it is needed. Since surgeons must individually tension each graft, there is a lot of variance between graft tensions across all ACL reconstruction patients. Furthermore, over time, the graft naturally loses tension with patient usage. There is no method to re-tension a graft other than performing a new ACL surgery.</p><h5 id="our-device"><a href="#our-device" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Our Device</h5><p>The TensiFixTM fixation device allows the surgeon to fix a graft at both ends, and then add more tension on the femoral side. When the graft loosens over time, a patient can choose a minor surgery where the surgeon goes back to the original graft and tighten TensiFixTM, thus adding more tensions without performing another major surgery.</p><div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-8 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/acl_pic/screw_cross_section.jpg">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/acl_pic/screw_exploded.png">\n    </div>\n</div><div><a name="inovation"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="inovation">Innovation</h3><p>Post surgically, ACL grafts have been seen to lose tension due to normal cyclic loads applied during rehabilitation (Singhal, et.al, 2005). As the tension in the graft decreases, the knee’s ability to translate anteriorly increases; an occurrence meant to be minimized by the ACL reconstructive surgery (Grover, et. al, 2005). With current fixation techniques, the amount of tension in the graft immediately after surgery is dependent on that which the surgeon can provide in the tibial fixation. With our device, the surgeon is able to add additional tension to the graft at the femoral site after both ends of the graft are fixed.</p><div><a name="impact"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="impact">Impact</h3><p>TensiFixTM’s surgical importance lies in its ability to allow the adjustment of the graft after it has already been fixed in place. Currently, ACL reconstruction grafts are tensioned by manually pulling on the graft before fixation (Fu, Cohen 2006). This method can have many pitfalls. For example, variability in graft tension is associated with manual tensioning, as manual methods have been proven to be irreproducible from patient to patient (O’Neill, et al 2011). Also, fixation after tensioning limits the surgeon’s inability to further tension the graft if need arises. Thus, if the graft were to either not have enough tension initially or lose tension over time due to factors such as lengthening due to cyclic loading, the surgeon would have to redo the reconstruction to add tension to the graft (Harvey, et al. 2005). TensiFixTM functions like a regular Endobutton, allowing the surgeon to manually tension and fix the graft using the current manual method. However, should the fixed graft somehow lose tension, TensiFixTM’s tensioning screw can be backed out of its barrel, re-tensioning the graft. Thus, the surgeon is not forced to redo the entire reconstruction to tension the graft.</p><div><a name="sig"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="sig">Significance</h3><p>TensiFixTM is able to easily increase the tension during the ACL reconstruction. It addresses the need for a reliable way to increase the tension in knee ligament reconstruction surgeries. It uses an adjustable barrel-screw mechanism that is capable of adding tension to an existing graft. The TensiFixTM consists of three components: an externally threaded suture retainer, an internally threaded hexagonal barrel and a flat button retainer.</p><div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/acl_pic/insertion_cropped.png">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-8 columns">\n        <p>\n        The device comes pre-assembled before being implanted. The surgeon will thread a suture through the hexagonal hole in the flat button and though the externally and internally threaded barrel. The suture is then attached through the hole for each component. The barrel will come pre-assembled in the lowest position possible to allow for the greatest range of tension to be applied. The suture is then looped through a double bundle graft.<div>The device with the graft attached to it will be pulled through the end of the femoral tunnel and mounted at the end of the tunnel. The surgeon then places the barrel/retainer assembly into the hexagonal button and the graft is threaded through a femoral tunnel similar to the currently used EndoButton procedure. The TensiFixTM is then screwed out. It has the added benefit of being able to be adjusted post operatively. This allows surgeons to increase the graft tension in a quick and measurable way.\n</p>\n</div></div></div><ul class="small-block-grid-2">\n    <li><img class="th" src="./images/acl_pic/flattening_cropped.png"></li>\n    <li><img class="th" src="./images/acl_pic/tightening_cropped.png"></li>\n</ul></div>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/undergrad/tensiflex/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:4,frontmatter:{date:"2013-04-29T21:46:56.000Z",tags:["undergraduate","BME"],title:"Alternative ACL Fixation Device"},fields:{slug:"/undergrad/tensiflex/"}},{excerpt:"Each person in our group performed a contextual interview with a another student in the class.

For more than 60 years the organization has worked to protect central New Jersey’s water and environment through conservation, advocacy, science, and education. The new center will incorporate exhibits, classrooms, and a laboratory that focus on helping people to understand environmental issues and take the proper steps for a better future. The center’s many green systems, which include geothermal hvac, diurnal ducting, wetlands-based wastewater treatment, a green roof,\nsolar arrays, and more, will all serve to reduce the impact the center has on the environment. However, to fully achieve their mission statement, the association seeks to install an interactive exhibit that draws on data and educates visitors on sustainable building practices.</p>\n<p>Our goal for this project is to design an exhibit that can appeal to children, homeowners, contractors/building officials, and policy makers to enhance their understanding of human systems and encourage environmental sustainability in specific real-world contexts.</p>\n<div><a name="research"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="research">Research</h3>\n<p>In order to gain a basic understanding of how individual interact with museum exhibits, we spent several hours in a few museums noting the interactions and movements of individuals. We spent approximately 30 minutes in each of the exhibit spaces recording notable interactions and break-downs that users had with each particular exhibit. In order to capture the largest number of interactions, we split up into two teams and rotated between the different museums.</p>\n<div>From this research, we discovered numerous factors that influence a visitor’s museum journey from start to finish. The critical points to consider in this journey are the surprise or the event trigger, the interaction and knowledge acquired from such interaction and finally the transfer of such knowledge beyond the exhibit tour. In order to achieve this, we should create a novel and/or well- guided experience, facilitate collaboration between visitors, cater to the physical constraints of a visitor, understand what is important or unimportant to the visitor and last but not least provide a memorable experience that one can apply in context of the real world.\n<br/>\n<br/></div>\n<img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/museum_model.png">\nOur model that we used to explain an individual\'s exhibit experience.\n<div><a name="ideas"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="ideas">Ideation</h3>\n<p>We began brainstorming with an independent idea generation process. We sat in a room and, working alone, came up with as many exhibit ideas as possible in 15 minutes. There were no restrictions on scope, cost, or absurdity. At the conclusion of our time, we had a total of 40 concepts ranging from the very practical informational wall display to the slightly-less-conventional sculpture to simulate the water process through the movement of metal balls. </p>\n<p>The low-fi design that we settled on is a tabletop game to allow for the comparison of features and simulation of data. We envision a touch sensitive table top, upon which users move physical pieces representing each of the different features of the Environmental Center. Users would be able to pick up and move these pieces (like chess pieces), the goal being to move the correct physical pieces into the center of the table, where they would effectively be added to a digital representation of the building.</p>\n<p>Regarding gameplay, we wanted to give users tasks that would challenge them to learn about environmental features, and understand how they fit into an overall system. As a way to encourage deeper learning of the concepts, we wanted to be able to present different contexts for users to apply their knowledge. We also envisioned this as providing motivation for users to engage with the game, and to continue exploring content. For example, upon starting the game, users might be given the task to add features that would be relevant to a building in a desert environment. Users would then need to find out what features might be best suited in such an environment. They would be given the ability to see (through simulation) what the effectiveness and impact is of the features that they add.</p>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/tabletop_idea.png">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/energy_flow_idea.png">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/augmented_reality_idea.png">\n    </div>\n</div>\nSome concepts from ideation.\n<div><a name="product"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="product">Product</h3>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>The concept for the game is to have players build their own environmentally sustainable building while learning about the various features that go into it. Players can choose from a number of different features, such as solar panels, geothermal heating and cooling, and rain barrels, which can be incorporated into their building. The game also allows for players to change the size of their building and the environmental region it is located in. All of these variables impact the overall energy consumption and savings of a player’s building, so players are challenged to make informed decisions about the features they add. Furthermore, players are restricted by a budget that reflects real world costs, giving players incentive to weigh the up-front costs against long term benefits. At the end of the game, players are presented with a graph of their building’s projected energy consumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/info_screen.png"/>\n        <p>System Information</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/preference_screen.png"/>\n        <p>User Preferences</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>The game itself is both digital and physical. We use a touch screen as the game tabletop, which displays the interfaces, screens, animations, and content that players encounter. The player’s building is represented digitally and occupies the center of the screen. The game’s physical components are the environmental features, which are unique 3D printed pieces. We track the position of these 3D pieces using a camera positioned above the gameboard. A key mechanic of the game is that when a player moves a 3D piece onto the touch screen, that feature is added to the player’s building. To remove a feature, players simply take the corresponding 3D piece off of the touch screen. While a piece is on the screen, players can see important information about that feature, and click on surrounding icons to learn more.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>Customization is a component we would like to emphasize in our game, and we want to give players control over how their building ultimately turns out.

An analytical commentary on the problems inherent in social structures, with particular emphasis placed on capitalism, the manifesto was commissioned by the Communist Party and serves as the basis for the communist movement that grew out of the nineteenth century.  What followed was an ideological split between followers and proponents of individualistic social structure (capitalism) and more community-oriented social structures, like those proposed in communism.  </p><p>This ideological shift served as the basis for our project.  We wanted to examine whether the changes in political and social thought were borne out in the language and lexicon used in the time period surrounding the publication of “The Communist Manifesto”.  Several research questions were of particular interest to us: do words identified as ‘communal’ words have similar patterns of frequency over our given time period? Do the ‘individualistic’ words?  We also would like to compare some data specific to “The Communist Manifesto” to our general dataset.</p><p>We expected to see several trends in the data that we analyzed.  As the ideological shift we  focused on involved an emphasis on group-mentality and social organization, we expected to see an increase in the frequency of the usage of words that we identified as being ‘communal’.  As the population became more aware of the ideas presented within the manifesto and inherent in communism, there would logically be a greater usage of terms related to those ideas.  Conversely, we hypothesized that there might be a slight decrease in the frequency usage of more ‘individualistic’ terms.  We treated ‘communal’ and ‘individualistic’ as antonyms, and as such, predicted an increase in one to suggest a decrease in the other. Additionally, we expected to see a correlation between like terms, in regards to plurality;  we anticipated seeing clusters, based on the pattern of frequency over time, of words we deemed to be ‘communal’ and ‘individualistic’ </p><p>Our project was two-pronged in nature, with a digital component and a humanistic analysis.  As outlined below, we needed to construct a digital tool capable of clustering the data that was of interest.  The tool produced a computational analysis of our primary source of data, the google Ngram corpus.  The tool returned data on the frequency of words used over our time period, 1840-1860, and clusters words that have similar usage frequency.  This data was then looked at through a humanistic lens, where we provided sociocultural explanations for the data and explored the limitations and biases of our project.</p><div><a name="related"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="related">Related Work</h3><p>In 2012, Jean Twenge, M. Keith Campbell, and Brittany Gentile published an article that included two studies they conducted on the usage of individualistic and communal terms.  Their studies focused on a perceived increase in use of individual-centric words and phrases between 1960 and 2008.  Like the analysis presented below, they are interested in examining the influence culture has on language.  They use a large corpus of book data that has been digitized as their primary source. They eventually conclude that the increase in individualistic words and phrases demonstrates a cultural shift toward American individualism in the second half of the twentieth century.  This article, and Twenge et al.’s work have been criticized for failing to account for specific events that happen within the time period that might alter language change.  Our project, in comparison, centers around a particular event in history, looking for language change that may be related to that event.\nIn our research, we turned to a fair amount of existing work that investigates the relationship of language to Marxism. In many of the studies we came across, social class became the primary concern, with a focus on the veiling effect of specific language. This is related to the expression of distinct ideas by a certain social class within a larger national language. An example is Valentinin Voloshiov’s “Marxism and the Philosophy of Language”, which deals with how ideologies shape language. Another reference point is “Marxist Linguistic Theory and Communist Practice: A Sociolinguistic Study” by Max K. Adler, in which language is thought of as a product of society, and society as a product of language. If this is indeed the case, we would expect to see such forces at work within our Ngram data.</p><p>Another way that our research is distinct from existing work, is that we seek to quantify the changes that occur within language and ideologies after the publication of “The Communist Manifesto”. By tracking the rise or decline in particular language, we expect to make visible the linguistic trends that may coincide with historical events.</p><div><a name="method"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="method">Methodology</h3><p>Do to computational limitations, the tool was designed to output data relating to the top 25,000 most frequently used 1-grams in the general English corpus from 1840-1860. To do this, we filtered through the time-series information for all of the 1-grams in the corpus and sorted them by their maximum volume count. Therefore, a word was considered to be in the top 25,000 only if it was featured in a variety of writings. Unfortunately, we were unable to normalize words based on their relative frequency, due to the floating point limitation of the double data type e.g. the numbers were too small to compute. </p><p>After the preprocessing, we decided to utilize the K-medoids clustering algorithms to cluster words that have similar time series. For our K-medoids distance function, rather than using standard euclidean distance, we decided to use Pearson’s product correlation coefficient. Pearson’s correlation controls for different locations and scales of the two time series, which was useful to us so we could account for the base-usage of a word (the location), and the response a related word would have (the scale). Ideally, using this distance function allowed us to detect a larger selection of correlated words, rather than just those with a high euclidean similarity. Initially we were planning on utilizing K-means as our clustering method, however it did not end up performing well using Pearson’s correlation as a distance function. The cluster assignment and centroid update function did not end up converging, therefore the algorithm never truly ran correctly. K-medoids, which can handle arbitrary distance functions, ended up being a better fit for us.</p><p>We used the Java-ML implementation of the algorithm, due to its high regard in the community and its availability. We ran the algorithm 10 times, with a maximum of 1000 clusters for each run and at least 100 iterations of the algorithm. We took the 10 runs of the algorithm and calculated the sum of centroid similarities for each run. The run with the highest sum of similarities was then taken as the final set of clusters. The resulting set of clusters were exported and then used in a custom-made view. The view allows for an individual to search for a word, view the other words clustered with it, view the time-series for each word and view the average time-series of the individual time-series. </p><p>Following the production of the digital clustering tool, we input our lists of ‘individualistic’ and ‘communal’ words.  As a note, these word lists are primarily taken from a previous study on plurality performed by Twenge, Campbell, and Gentile in 2012.  Twenge’s study also focused on examining the distinction between plural and individualistic words and language’s relation to culture.  We used their word lists as the basis for our own, modifying them slightly to be more applicable to our specific project and time period of study.  In inputting the words, we were interested in which words the tool identified as belonging to the same cluster, as well as the frequency curve associated with each cluster.  The frequency curves can be produced by taking the numeric data that the tool outputs for each clustered word and inserting it into a basic Microsoft excel file and making a line chart.  Examples of frequency charts can be found in Appendix C.   The input words and the words they clustered with can be found in Appendix B.</p><p>We looked at Twenge’s study again when considering what methods might be potentially effective. For instance, Twenge made use of Mechanical Turk to have participants rate words on a scale from most ‘individualistic’ to most ‘communal’. Crowdsourcing can certainly be an effective tool for dealing with subtle or subjective questions. However, our system of clustering avoids such arbitrary rating systems and provides us with much more data driven results.</p><p>We also used Wheaton College’s online Lexos analysis tool to identify the top 50 words used in the Communist Manifesto. After removing common English stopwords, the resulting wordcloud served as a starting point for us to begin testing our clustering tool.</p><div><a name="results"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="results">Results</h3><p>We have represented our results visually in the appendices at the end of this paper.  The first appendix outlines the thirty words, fifteen ‘individualistic’ and fifteen ‘communal’, that would wanted to closely examine.  The second appendix consists of a table which displays each of the thirty words that we input into the clustering tool and the resulting cluster of words that the tool identified as having similar frequency patterns.  The third, and final, appendix has a sample of the line graphs associated with the selected words.<br>\nUpon closer analysis, several interesting results were apparent.  Of the fifteen ‘individualistic’ words that we identified in our word lists fourteen returned clusters; “Uniqueness” was not in the top 25,000 most frequent words in the Ngram data and did not return a cluster.  Of the fifteen ‘communal’ words, only eleven returned clusters; the inputs “communal”, “communitarian”, “socialism”, and “collectivism” did not return clusters.  Also, the average size of an ‘individualistic’ cluster was 65.286 words.  The average size of a ‘communal’ cluster was 46.545.  The averages were determined by summing up the total words in one of the two categories and dividing by the number of terms that output clusters.  (See Appendix B)</p><p>In terms of upward or downward tendencies, all of the graphs produced using the numerical data for each clustered word show an increase over time.  That is, the average line graph of each cluster increases over the time period.  We did not see any decreasing graphs.  (See Appendix C)</p><div><a name="discuss"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="discuss">Discussion</h3><p>The quantitative data that was output by the digital tool served as the basis for further analysis.  Below, we explore our research questions in relation to the data, discuss assumptions that we made in our project, outline biases of our project, and propose implications for future research. </p><p>Our hypothesis regarding the increase of plural term usage over the period from 1840-1860 was, in part, based on the assumption that words with similar meanings would have similar frequency graphs.  In using the clustering tool, we hoped to see these frequency clusters of semantically-related terms.  Specifically, we hoped to see ‘communal’ words clustered with other ‘communal’ words, indicating that they followed similar frequency patterns.  We expected the frequency patterns of such clusters to increase over the course of our chosen time period. Such a result would provide some support for our hypothesis that there was a shift in ideology, a move toward a more group-oriented frame of thought, that was evident in the lexicon.   </p><p>Our results however, did not display clusters that were as semantically-connected as we had predicted.  Some words did tend to cluster with like words, but many of our sample words produced clusters that were wide-ranging with no apparent semantic link (see appendix B).</p><p>With the knowledge that the graphs produced by inputting the numerical data about word frequencies into Excel covered more semantic territory than just ‘communal’ or ‘individualistic’ words, we still thought there might be value in looking at more general upward and downward trends across the data.  All of the graphs we produced from the data display an increase.  This increase is the result of the tool outputting the raw data on the frequency of the words themselves, which will naturally increase over time.  In order to actually look at the increase or decrease of specific words without interference, we would need to have relative frequencies for the terms.  Unfortunately, due to computational limitations, the relative frequencies would be too small analyze.  We would need to recompute the relative frequencies and graph those, and unfortunately we did not have time to do so. Therefore, we were unable to reach concrete conclusions about increase or decrease in our two categories. </p><p>In our effort to examine the direct influence of a single text, we also pulled out the most frequent words in The Communist Manifesto, in hopes of comparing their frequencies over the time period in question.  Unfortunately, many of the words that were used extensively in Marx’s text were not among the top 25,000 words identified in the Ngram data.  Words like ‘proletariat’ and ‘bourgeoisie’, that are integral to the manifesto and to the ideology underlying the text, are not present. Thus, we were unable to track the use of the words and their frequencies.  This suggests that these words were not largely in use in the time period we examined. </p><p>In fact, it may be the case that the Communist Manifesto simply was not as influential as we would have expected, given the emphasis modern society places on the text.  Our data suggests, though not empirically, that the manifesto’s impact on the overall lexicon from 1840-1860 was limited, if present at all.   We were not able to attribute any specific lexical change to the manifesto itself.  </p><p>While the scope of our project and results was not such that we can make any claims on whether the publication of The Communist Manifesto impacted the lexicon of the time period that we examined, we can explore other implications of the data.  As mentioned above, the Communist Manifesto uses highly specific language, meaning that many of its most crucial terms do not show up in the most common language of the time we investigated. This being the case, it became an interesting question for us to consider what terms might be most revealing about the culture of this period. For instance, if we look at the word ‘industrial’, which does show up in the top 50 words of the Communist Manifesto, we see that its usage follows a similar change over time as the word ‘atheism’. While this could be significant, even obvious, let us also consider that ‘industrial’ clusters with such words as ‘accidents’, ‘blinds’, ‘successes’, and ‘villages’. Some of these clusters seem predictable, others seem to reveal more subtle connections, and still others seem arbitrary or difficult to draw meaning from. For future work, perhaps additional methods can be implemented in order to aid in interpretation</p><p>A possible bias of our data comes from the fact that the English publication date of the Communist Manifesto (1950) is situated squarely within the time period we investigated (1840-1860). We chose this time frame because it allowed us to not only examine the forces at work leading up to the manifesto, but also those immediately following its publication. However, this is perhaps too limited a time period, as we suspect that the linguistic impact of the manifesto might not be noticeable until much later than 1860.\nOne possible implication of our study is that the impact of any single culturally significant literary work, be it the Communist Manifesto, The Wealth of Nations, or any other work, is far less immediate and apparent than what might be expected. Thus, it might be necessary to investigate linguistic data at a much larger scope.  </p><p>For example, looking at parts of speech might reveal even more.  An interesting result that we noted during the examination of our data was that nouns tended to cluster with words that were more easily identifiable as being related by meaning.  Other parts of speech, like adjectives and adverbs, produced more scattered results.  Words that had both a noun form and an adjective form also did not produce very clear clusters.  For example, the word ‘individual’, which can be both a noun or a descriptive adjective, clustered with words that ranged from other adjectives (adequate, comprehensive), verbs (deducing, eject) and other nouns.  The nouns that clustered with individual (art, auxiliary, compulsion, fete, handmaid, individual, nicety, serpents, species, superstructure, sweets, uncertainty, veracity) ranged from concepts to tangible objects and, arguably, included more words related to ‘communal’ ideas than ‘individual’ ones. </p><p>Additionally, a closer examination of the words in each cluster could add depth to the analysis.  For example, it might be worthwhile to look at the positivity or negativity of the words that cluster together.  Coding words as negative or positive could give more insight into ideological change over time.  It might be the case that words with similar positive or negative connotations group together.  We noted that a large number of words that are traditionally perceived as negative appeared in the clusters of the ‘individualistic’ terms.  For example, the word “independent” clusters with “abandon”, “conflicting”, “confusion”, “danger”, “destroying”, and “difficulties”.  It should be noted that positive words also appear in the cluster, but to a lesser degree.  Exploring this tendency in future research might lead to interesting conclusions. </p><p>Overall, this project resulted in the production of a digital tool that has wide-ranging applications.  While we discovered that its use in exploring a singular text, in this case “The Communist Manifesto”, as indicative of larger social context may not always be possible, it is at our disposal for future research.  Ideally, we could now apply this tool to a larger variety of questions with more concrete foundations and more correct parameters of interest. </p></div>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/undergrad/francis-bacon/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:12,frontmatter:{date:"2013-12-01T21:46:56.000Z",tags:["undergraduate","HCI","software","ML"],title:"Six Degrees of Francis Bacon - Clustering"},fields:{slug:"/undergrad/francis-bacon/"}},{excerpt:"Each person in our group performed a contextual interview with a another student in the class.

For more than 60 years the organization has worked to protect central New Jersey’s water and environment through conservation, advocacy, science, and education. The new center will incorporate exhibits, classrooms, and a laboratory that focus on helping people to understand environmental issues and take the proper steps for a better future. The center’s many green systems, which include geothermal hvac, diurnal ducting, wetlands-based wastewater treatment, a green roof,\nsolar arrays, and more, will all serve to reduce the impact the center has on the environment. However, to fully achieve their mission statement, the association seeks to install an interactive exhibit that draws on data and educates visitors on sustainable building practices.</p>\n<p>Our goal for this project is to design an exhibit that can appeal to children, homeowners, contractors/building officials, and policy makers to enhance their understanding of human systems and encourage environmental sustainability in specific real-world contexts.</p>\n<div><a name="research"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="research">Research</h3>\n<p>In order to gain a basic understanding of how individual interact with museum exhibits, we spent several hours in a few museums noting the interactions and movements of individuals. We spent approximately 30 minutes in each of the exhibit spaces recording notable interactions and break-downs that users had with each particular exhibit. In order to capture the largest number of interactions, we split up into two teams and rotated between the different museums.</p>\n<div>From this research, we discovered numerous factors that influence a visitor’s museum journey from start to finish. The critical points to consider in this journey are the surprise or the event trigger, the interaction and knowledge acquired from such interaction and finally the transfer of such knowledge beyond the exhibit tour. In order to achieve this, we should create a novel and/or well- guided experience, facilitate collaboration between visitors, cater to the physical constraints of a visitor, understand what is important or unimportant to the visitor and last but not least provide a memorable experience that one can apply in context of the real world.\n<br/>\n<br/></div>\n<img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/museum_model.png">\nOur model that we used to explain an individual\'s exhibit experience.\n<div><a name="ideas"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="ideas">Ideation</h3>\n<p>We began brainstorming with an independent idea generation process. We sat in a room and, working alone, came up with as many exhibit ideas as possible in 15 minutes. There were no restrictions on scope, cost, or absurdity. At the conclusion of our time, we had a total of 40 concepts ranging from the very practical informational wall display to the slightly-less-conventional sculpture to simulate the water process through the movement of metal balls. </p>\n<p>The low-fi design that we settled on is a tabletop game to allow for the comparison of features and simulation of data. We envision a touch sensitive table top, upon which users move physical pieces representing each of the different features of the Environmental Center. Users would be able to pick up and move these pieces (like chess pieces), the goal being to move the correct physical pieces into the center of the table, where they would effectively be added to a digital representation of the building.</p>\n<p>Regarding gameplay, we wanted to give users tasks that would challenge them to learn about environmental features, and understand how they fit into an overall system. As a way to encourage deeper learning of the concepts, we wanted to be able to present different contexts for users to apply their knowledge. We also envisioned this as providing motivation for users to engage with the game, and to continue exploring content. For example, upon starting the game, users might be given the task to add features that would be relevant to a building in a desert environment. Users would then need to find out what features might be best suited in such an environment. They would be given the ability to see (through simulation) what the effectiveness and impact is of the features that they add.</p>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/tabletop_idea.png">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/energy_flow_idea.png">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/augmented_reality_idea.png">\n    </div>\n</div>\nSome concepts from ideation.\n<div><a name="product"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="product">Product</h3>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>The concept for the game is to have players build their own environmentally sustainable building while learning about the various features that go into it. Players can choose from a number of different features, such as solar panels, geothermal heating and cooling, and rain barrels, which can be incorporated into their building. The game also allows for players to change the size of their building and the environmental region it is located in. All of these variables impact the overall energy consumption and savings of a player’s building, so players are challenged to make informed decisions about the features they add. Furthermore, players are restricted by a budget that reflects real world costs, giving players incentive to weigh the up-front costs against long term benefits. At the end of the game, players are presented with a graph of their building’s projected energy consumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/info_screen.png"/>\n        <p>System Information</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/preference_screen.png"/>\n        <p>User Preferences</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>The game itself is both digital and physical. We use a touch screen as the game tabletop, which displays the interfaces, screens, animations, and content that players encounter. The player’s building is represented digitally and occupies the center of the screen. The game’s physical components are the environmental features, which are unique 3D printed pieces. We track the position of these 3D pieces using a camera positioned above the gameboard. A key mechanic of the game is that when a player moves a 3D piece onto the touch screen, that feature is added to the player’s building. To remove a feature, players simply take the corresponding 3D piece off of the touch screen. While a piece is on the screen, players can see important information about that feature, and click on surrounding icons to learn more.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>Customization is a component we would like to emphasize in our game, and we want to give players control over how their building ultimately turns out. We believe that this will add to the open-endedness of the game, making it more fun to play and replay, while also enhancing learning. Since our game is ultimately an educational one, our primary educational objective is to provide players with a general knowledge of environmentally sustainable practices. Our hope is that the knowledge and insights acquired within the game can transfer to real world situations for users.</p>\n        <p>In the following section, we revisit each iteration of the prototype and explain the process as we improve on and test with each version, from start to finish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/round_screen.png"/>\n        <p>Round Ending Screen</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div><a name="presentation"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="presentation">Presentation</h3>\n<iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/34585436" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/undergrad/eco-touch/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:5,frontmatter:{date:"2014-05-12T16:29:56.000Z",tags:["undergraduate","HCI","software","javascript"],title:"EcoTouch"},fields:{slug:"/undergrad/eco-touch/"}},{excerpt:"Background From the fall semester, in summary, we learned that: Grip force measurements from current devices, such as hand-held dynamometers, are poorly correlated with patients’ gripping performance during functional tasks, e.g. grabbing a can of…",html:'<h3 id="background"><a href="#background" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Background</h3>\n<p>From the fall semester, in summary, we learned that:</p>\n<p>Grip force measurements from current devices, such as hand-held dynamometers, are poorly correlated with patients’ gripping performance during functional tasks, e.g. grabbing a can of soda. These devices are unfamiliar to patients, can’t measure the five major types of grip, and lack the diagnostic resolution of a force distribution. Therefore, Improved assessment of patients’ gripping ability is necessary to identify the efficacy of treatments for grip-related disabilities.</p>\n<p>This translates well into the current market:</p>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="small-12 columns">\n        \n  <a class="gatsby-resp-image-link" href="/static/market-a79698420fa7f8439467932e9320a9fe-35896.png" style="display: block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">\n  \n  <span class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper" style="position: relative;

An analytical commentary on the problems inherent in social structures, with particular emphasis placed on capitalism, the manifesto was commissioned by the Communist Party and serves as the basis for the communist movement that grew out of the nineteenth century.  What followed was an ideological split between followers and proponents of individualistic social structure (capitalism) and more community-oriented social structures, like those proposed in communism.  </p><p>This ideological shift served as the basis for our project.  We wanted to examine whether the changes in political and social thought were borne out in the language and lexicon used in the time period surrounding the publication of “The Communist Manifesto”.  Several research questions were of particular interest to us: do words identified as ‘communal’ words have similar patterns of frequency over our given time period? Do the ‘individualistic’ words?  We also would like to compare some data specific to “The Communist Manifesto” to our general dataset.</p><p>We expected to see several trends in the data that we analyzed.  As the ideological shift we  focused on involved an emphasis on group-mentality and social organization, we expected to see an increase in the frequency of the usage of words that we identified as being ‘communal’.  As the population became more aware of the ideas presented within the manifesto and inherent in communism, there would logically be a greater usage of terms related to those ideas.  Conversely, we hypothesized that there might be a slight decrease in the frequency usage of more ‘individualistic’ terms.  We treated ‘communal’ and ‘individualistic’ as antonyms, and as such, predicted an increase in one to suggest a decrease in the other. Additionally, we expected to see a correlation between like terms, in regards to plurality;  we anticipated seeing clusters, based on the pattern of frequency over time, of words we deemed to be ‘communal’ and ‘individualistic’ </p><p>Our project was two-pronged in nature, with a digital component and a humanistic analysis.  As outlined below, we needed to construct a digital tool capable of clustering the data that was of interest.  The tool produced a computational analysis of our primary source of data, the google Ngram corpus.  The tool returned data on the frequency of words used over our time period, 1840-1860, and clusters words that have similar usage frequency.  This data was then looked at through a humanistic lens, where we provided sociocultural explanations for the data and explored the limitations and biases of our project.</p><div><a name="related"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="related">Related Work</h3><p>In 2012, Jean Twenge, M. Keith Campbell, and Brittany Gentile published an article that included two studies they conducted on the usage of individualistic and communal terms.  Their studies focused on a perceived increase in use of individual-centric words and phrases between 1960 and 2008.  Like the analysis presented below, they are interested in examining the influence culture has on language.  They use a large corpus of book data that has been digitized as their primary source. They eventually conclude that the increase in individualistic words and phrases demonstrates a cultural shift toward American individualism in the second half of the twentieth century.  This article, and Twenge et al.’s work have been criticized for failing to account for specific events that happen within the time period that might alter language change.  Our project, in comparison, centers around a particular event in history, looking for language change that may be related to that event.\nIn our research, we turned to a fair amount of existing work that investigates the relationship of language to Marxism. In many of the studies we came across, social class became the primary concern, with a focus on the veiling effect of specific language. This is related to the expression of distinct ideas by a certain social class within a larger national language. An example is Valentinin Voloshiov’s “Marxism and the Philosophy of Language”, which deals with how ideologies shape language. Another reference point is “Marxist Linguistic Theory and Communist Practice: A Sociolinguistic Study” by Max K. Adler, in which language is thought of as a product of society, and society as a product of language. If this is indeed the case, we would expect to see such forces at work within our Ngram data.</p><p>Another way that our research is distinct from existing work, is that we seek to quantify the changes that occur within language and ideologies after the publication of “The Communist Manifesto”. By tracking the rise or decline in particular language, we expect to make visible the linguistic trends that may coincide with historical events.</p><div><a name="method"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="method">Methodology</h3><p>Do to computational limitations, the tool was designed to output data relating to the top 25,000 most frequently used 1-grams in the general English corpus from 1840-1860. To do this, we filtered through the time-series information for all of the 1-grams in the corpus and sorted them by their maximum volume count. Therefore, a word was considered to be in the top 25,000 only if it was featured in a variety of writings. Unfortunately, we were unable to normalize words based on their relative frequency, due to the floating point limitation of the double data type e.g. the numbers were too small to compute. </p><p>After the preprocessing, we decided to utilize the K-medoids clustering algorithms to cluster words that have similar time series. For our K-medoids distance function, rather than using standard euclidean distance, we decided to use Pearson’s product correlation coefficient. Pearson’s correlation controls for different locations and scales of the two time series, which was useful to us so we could account for the base-usage of a word (the location), and the response a related word would have (the scale). Ideally, using this distance function allowed us to detect a larger selection of correlated words, rather than just those with a high euclidean similarity. Initially we were planning on utilizing K-means as our clustering method, however it did not end up performing well using Pearson’s correlation as a distance function. The cluster assignment and centroid update function did not end up converging, therefore the algorithm never truly ran correctly. K-medoids, which can handle arbitrary distance functions, ended up being a better fit for us.</p><p>We used the Java-ML implementation of the algorithm, due to its high regard in the community and its availability. We ran the algorithm 10 times, with a maximum of 1000 clusters for each run and at least 100 iterations of the algorithm. We took the 10 runs of the algorithm and calculated the sum of centroid similarities for each run. The run with the highest sum of similarities was then taken as the final set of clusters. The resulting set of clusters were exported and then used in a custom-made view. The view allows for an individual to search for a word, view the other words clustered with it, view the time-series for each word and view the average time-series of the individual time-series. </p><p>Following the production of the digital clustering tool, we input our lists of ‘individualistic’ and ‘communal’ words.  As a note, these word lists are primarily taken from a previous study on plurality performed by Twenge, Campbell, and Gentile in 2012.  Twenge’s study also focused on examining the distinction between plural and individualistic words and language’s relation to culture.  We used their word lists as the basis for our own, modifying them slightly to be more applicable to our specific project and time period of study.  In inputting the words, we were interested in which words the tool identified as belonging to the same cluster, as well as the frequency curve associated with each cluster.  The frequency curves can be produced by taking the numeric data that the tool outputs for each clustered word and inserting it into a basic Microsoft excel file and making a line chart.  Examples of frequency charts can be found in Appendix C.   The input words and the words they clustered with can be found in Appendix B.</p><p>We looked at Twenge’s study again when considering what methods might be potentially effective. For instance, Twenge made use of Mechanical Turk to have participants rate words on a scale from most ‘individualistic’ to most ‘communal’. Crowdsourcing can certainly be an effective tool for dealing with subtle or subjective questions. However, our system of clustering avoids such arbitrary rating systems and provides us with much more data driven results.</p><p>We also used Wheaton College’s online Lexos analysis tool to identify the top 50 words used in the Communist Manifesto. After removing common English stopwords, the resulting wordcloud served as a starting point for us to begin testing our clustering tool.</p><div><a name="results"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="results">Results</h3><p>We have represented our results visually in the appendices at the end of this paper.  The first appendix outlines the thirty words, fifteen ‘individualistic’ and fifteen ‘communal’, that would wanted to closely examine.  The second appendix consists of a table which displays each of the thirty words that we input into the clustering tool and the resulting cluster of words that the tool identified as having similar frequency patterns.  The third, and final, appendix has a sample of the line graphs associated with the selected words.<br>\nUpon closer analysis, several interesting results were apparent.  Of the fifteen ‘individualistic’ words that we identified in our word lists fourteen returned clusters; “Uniqueness” was not in the top 25,000 most frequent words in the Ngram data and did not return a cluster.  Of the fifteen ‘communal’ words, only eleven returned clusters; the inputs “communal”, “communitarian”, “socialism”, and “collectivism” did not return clusters.  Also, the average size of an ‘individualistic’ cluster was 65.286 words.  The average size of a ‘communal’ cluster was 46.545.  The averages were determined by summing up the total words in one of the two categories and dividing by the number of terms that output clusters.  (See Appendix B)</p><p>In terms of upward or downward tendencies, all of the graphs produced using the numerical data for each clustered word show an increase over time.  That is, the average line graph of each cluster increases over the time period.  We did not see any decreasing graphs.  (See Appendix C)</p><div><a name="discuss"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="discuss">Discussion</h3><p>The quantitative data that was output by the digital tool served as the basis for further analysis.  Below, we explore our research questions in relation to the data, discuss assumptions that we made in our project, outline biases of our project, and propose implications for future research. </p><p>Our hypothesis regarding the increase of plural term usage over the period from 1840-1860 was, in part, based on the assumption that words with similar meanings would have similar frequency graphs.  In using the clustering tool, we hoped to see these frequency clusters of semantically-related terms.  Specifically, we hoped to see ‘communal’ words clustered with other ‘communal’ words, indicating that they followed similar frequency patterns.  We expected the frequency patterns of such clusters to increase over the course of our chosen time period. Such a result would provide some support for our hypothesis that there was a shift in ideology, a move toward a more group-oriented frame of thought, that was evident in the lexicon.   </p><p>Our results however, did not display clusters that were as semantically-connected as we had predicted.  Some words did tend to cluster with like words, but many of our sample words produced clusters that were wide-ranging with no apparent semantic link (see appendix B).</p><p>With the knowledge that the graphs produced by inputting the numerical data about word frequencies into Excel covered more semantic territory than just ‘communal’ or ‘individualistic’ words, we still thought there might be value in looking at more general upward and downward trends across the data.  All of the graphs we produced from the data display an increase.  This increase is the result of the tool outputting the raw data on the frequency of the words themselves, which will naturally increase over time.  In order to actually look at the increase or decrease of specific words without interference, we would need to have relative frequencies for the terms.  Unfortunately, due to computational limitations, the relative frequencies would be too small analyze.  We would need to recompute the relative frequencies and graph those, and unfortunately we did not have time to do so. Therefore, we were unable to reach concrete conclusions about increase or decrease in our two categories. </p><p>In our effort to examine the direct influence of a single text, we also pulled out the most frequent words in The Communist Manifesto, in hopes of comparing their frequencies over the time period in question.  Unfortunately, many of the words that were used extensively in Marx’s text were not among the top 25,000 words identified in the Ngram data.  Words like ‘proletariat’ and ‘bourgeoisie’, that are integral to the manifesto and to the ideology underlying the text, are not present. Thus, we were unable to track the use of the words and their frequencies.  This suggests that these words were not largely in use in the time period we examined. </p><p>In fact, it may be the case that the Communist Manifesto simply was not as influential as we would have expected, given the emphasis modern society places on the text.  Our data suggests, though not empirically, that the manifesto’s impact on the overall lexicon from 1840-1860 was limited, if present at all.   We were not able to attribute any specific lexical change to the manifesto itself.  </p><p>While the scope of our project and results was not such that we can make any claims on whether the publication of The Communist Manifesto impacted the lexicon of the time period that we examined, we can explore other implications of the data.  As mentioned above, the Communist Manifesto uses highly specific language, meaning that many of its most crucial terms do not show up in the most common language of the time we investigated. This being the case, it became an interesting question for us to consider what terms might be most revealing about the culture of this period. For instance, if we look at the word ‘industrial’, which does show up in the top 50 words of the Communist Manifesto, we see that its usage follows a similar change over time as the word ‘atheism’. While this could be significant, even obvious, let us also consider that ‘industrial’ clusters with such words as ‘accidents’, ‘blinds’, ‘successes’, and ‘villages’. Some of these clusters seem predictable, others seem to reveal more subtle connections, and still others seem arbitrary or difficult to draw meaning from. For future work, perhaps additional methods can be implemented in order to aid in interpretation</p><p>A possible bias of our data comes from the fact that the English publication date of the Communist Manifesto (1950) is situated squarely within the time period we investigated (1840-1860). We chose this time frame because it allowed us to not only examine the forces at work leading up to the manifesto, but also those immediately following its publication. However, this is perhaps too limited a time period, as we suspect that the linguistic impact of the manifesto might not be noticeable until much later than 1860.\nOne possible implication of our study is that the impact of any single culturally significant literary work, be it the Communist Manifesto, The Wealth of Nations, or any other work, is far less immediate and apparent than what might be expected. Thus, it might be necessary to investigate linguistic data at a much larger scope.  </p><p>For example, looking at parts of speech might reveal even more.  An interesting result that we noted during the examination of our data was that nouns tended to cluster with words that were more easily identifiable as being related by meaning.  Other parts of speech, like adjectives and adverbs, produced more scattered results.  Words that had both a noun form and an adjective form also did not produce very clear clusters.  For example, the word ‘individual’, which can be both a noun or a descriptive adjective, clustered with words that ranged from other adjectives (adequate, comprehensive), verbs (deducing, eject) and other nouns.  The nouns that clustered with individual (art, auxiliary, compulsion, fete, handmaid, individual, nicety, serpents, species, superstructure, sweets, uncertainty, veracity) ranged from concepts to tangible objects and, arguably, included more words related to ‘communal’ ideas than ‘individual’ ones. </p><p>Additionally, a closer examination of the words in each cluster could add depth to the analysis.  For example, it might be worthwhile to look at the positivity or negativity of the words that cluster together.  Coding words as negative or positive could give more insight into ideological change over time.  It might be the case that words with similar positive or negative connotations group together.  We noted that a large number of words that are traditionally perceived as negative appeared in the clusters of the ‘individualistic’ terms.  For example, the word “independent” clusters with “abandon”, “conflicting”, “confusion”, “danger”, “destroying”, and “difficulties”.  It should be noted that positive words also appear in the cluster, but to a lesser degree.  Exploring this tendency in future research might lead to interesting conclusions. </p><p>Overall, this project resulted in the production of a digital tool that has wide-ranging applications.  While we discovered that its use in exploring a singular text, in this case “The Communist Manifesto”, as indicative of larger social context may not always be possible, it is at our disposal for future research.  Ideally, we could now apply this tool to a larger variety of questions with more concrete foundations and more correct parameters of interest. </p></div>',

The Android application I created is an extension of this — it allows you to view any information you normally see through the web application on your phone. It does this by connecting to our Ruby on Rails server through an API I created to pair with the Android application. After using a token for authentication, users can view information about a room, including power consumption and sensor graphs, as well as control the room’s lights. As an extra feature, the application can detect with a user is in a room by using a Bluetooth LE beacon. </p>\n<img class="th" src="./images/greenlight_mobile/Greenlight_Mobile.002.png">\n<div><a name="architecture"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="architecture">Architecture</h3>\n<img class="th" src="./images/greenlight_mobile/Greenlight_Mobile.004.png">\n<p>The app utilizes two core components of the Android framework to manage its connection to the Ruby on Rails application.

This allows a user’s\n<a href="/portfolio/greenlight.html">Greenlight</a> account to appear in the general settings screen, and allow for background Bluetooth scanning preferences to be adjusted. </p>\n<p>For actually transmitting and receiving data, a custom content provider and cursor were implemented.

On bootup of the phone, a background service is started that attaches to the library and scans for broadcasts in the background. Once a broadcast is received, the phone creates a notification, informing the user that a greenlight system is nearby, and when selected, takes them to the appropriate room screen within the application.</p>\n<p>On average, the background scanning only reduced battery life by about 1 hour, and it is expected to improve with time. The low energy scanning implemented in Android is, at this point, only supposed to happen at discrete times, rather than constantly, however this constant scanning should hopefully become core in the future. </p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/undergrad/greenlight-mobile/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:2,frontmatter:{date:"2013-12-01T21:46:56.000Z",tags:["undergraduate","IS","software","Android"],title:"Greenlight - Mobile"},fields:{slug:"/undergrad/greenlight-mobile/"}},{excerpt:"The use of natural light in commercial settings is undervalued.

For more than 60 years the organization has worked to protect central New Jersey’s water and environment through conservation, advocacy, science, and education. The new center will incorporate exhibits, classrooms, and a laboratory that focus on helping people to understand environmental issues and take the proper steps for a better future. The center’s many green systems, which include geothermal hvac, diurnal ducting, wetlands-based wastewater treatment, a green roof,\nsolar arrays, and more, will all serve to reduce the impact the center has on the environment. However, to fully achieve their mission statement, the association seeks to install an interactive exhibit that draws on data and educates visitors on sustainable building practices.</p>\n<p>Our goal for this project is to design an exhibit that can appeal to children, homeowners, contractors/building officials, and policy makers to enhance their understanding of human systems and encourage environmental sustainability in specific real-world contexts.</p>\n<div><a name="research"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="research">Research</h3>\n<p>In order to gain a basic understanding of how individual interact with museum exhibits, we spent several hours in a few museums noting the interactions and movements of individuals. We spent approximately 30 minutes in each of the exhibit spaces recording notable interactions and break-downs that users had with each particular exhibit. In order to capture the largest number of interactions, we split up into two teams and rotated between the different museums.</p>\n<div>From this research, we discovered numerous factors that influence a visitor’s museum journey from start to finish. The critical points to consider in this journey are the surprise or the event trigger, the interaction and knowledge acquired from such interaction and finally the transfer of such knowledge beyond the exhibit tour. In order to achieve this, we should create a novel and/or well- guided experience, facilitate collaboration between visitors, cater to the physical constraints of a visitor, understand what is important or unimportant to the visitor and last but not least provide a memorable experience that one can apply in context of the real world.\n<br/>\n<br/></div>\n<img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/museum_model.png">\nOur model that we used to explain an individual\'s exhibit experience.\n<div><a name="ideas"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="ideas">Ideation</h3>\n<p>We began brainstorming with an independent idea generation process. We sat in a room and, working alone, came up with as many exhibit ideas as possible in 15 minutes. There were no restrictions on scope, cost, or absurdity. At the conclusion of our time, we had a total of 40 concepts ranging from the very practical informational wall display to the slightly-less-conventional sculpture to simulate the water process through the movement of metal balls. </p>\n<p>The low-fi design that we settled on is a tabletop game to allow for the comparison of features and simulation of data. We envision a touch sensitive table top, upon which users move physical pieces representing each of the different features of the Environmental Center. Users would be able to pick up and move these pieces (like chess pieces), the goal being to move the correct physical pieces into the center of the table, where they would effectively be added to a digital representation of the building.</p>\n<p>Regarding gameplay, we wanted to give users tasks that would challenge them to learn about environmental features, and understand how they fit into an overall system. As a way to encourage deeper learning of the concepts, we wanted to be able to present different contexts for users to apply their knowledge. We also envisioned this as providing motivation for users to engage with the game, and to continue exploring content. For example, upon starting the game, users might be given the task to add features that would be relevant to a building in a desert environment. Users would then need to find out what features might be best suited in such an environment. They would be given the ability to see (through simulation) what the effectiveness and impact is of the features that they add.</p>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/tabletop_idea.png">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/energy_flow_idea.png">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/augmented_reality_idea.png">\n    </div>\n</div>\nSome concepts from ideation.\n<div><a name="product"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="product">Product</h3>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>The concept for the game is to have players build their own environmentally sustainable building while learning about the various features that go into it. Players can choose from a number of different features, such as solar panels, geothermal heating and cooling, and rain barrels, which can be incorporated into their building. The game also allows for players to change the size of their building and the environmental region it is located in. All of these variables impact the overall energy consumption and savings of a player’s building, so players are challenged to make informed decisions about the features they add. Furthermore, players are restricted by a budget that reflects real world costs, giving players incentive to weigh the up-front costs against long term benefits. At the end of the game, players are presented with a graph of their building’s projected energy consumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/info_screen.png"/>\n        <p>System Information</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/ecotouch/preference_screen.png"/>\n        <p>User Preferences</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>The game itself is both digital and physical. We use a touch screen as the game tabletop, which displays the interfaces, screens, animations, and content that players encounter. The player’s building is represented digitally and occupies the center of the screen. The game’s physical components are the environmental features, which are unique 3D printed pieces. We track the position of these 3D pieces using a camera positioned above the gameboard. A key mechanic of the game is that when a player moves a 3D piece onto the touch screen, that feature is added to the player’s building. To remove a feature, players simply take the corresponding 3D piece off of the touch screen. While a piece is on the screen, players can see important information about that feature, and click on surrounding icons to learn more.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-6 columns">\n        <p>Customization is a component we would like to emphasize in our game, and we want to give players control over how their building ultimately turns out. We believe that this will add to the open-endedness of the game, making it more fun to play and replay, while also enhancing learning. Since our game is ultimately an educational one, our primary educational objective is to provide players with a general knowledge of environmentally sustainable practices.

Therefore, Improved assessment of patients’ gripping ability is necessary to identify the efficacy of treatments for grip-related disabilities.</p>\n<p>This translates well into the current market:</p>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="small-12 columns">\n        \n  <a class="gatsby-resp-image-link" href="/static/market-a79698420fa7f8439467932e9320a9fe-35896.png" style="display: block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">\n  \n  <span class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper" style="position: relative;

Although it would seem that graft strength is the most indicative property for ACL reconstruction stability, it is actually the strength of the graft fixation to the bone. (Urbibe, Arango, Frank, and Kiebzak, 2013) Fixation gives the graft bone tunnel interface necessary stiffness and strength (Woo, et al. 2000). There are many different fixation devices available, such as interference screws, soft tissue washers, suture-post constructs, simple staples, cross-pins, and titanium buttons (Woo, et al., 2000). Since the graft selection depends on the circumstance of the patient, different fixation techniques must be used as well. The current gold standard for fixation is the interference screw against a bone plug (Brand, 2000). One study suggests the most stable knee reconstruction is when the interference screw is positioned close to the articular surface with central and distal fixation (Ishibashi, et al., 1997).\nFurthermore, the tibia position relative to the femur when the graft is fixed has a considerable effect on the kinematics of the knee and the in situ force of the new graft (Hoher, et al., 1999). Specifically, when the graft is fixed at 30o knee flexion, with a 67N posterior tibial load, the resulting knee kinematics is closest to the native knee (Hoher, et al., 1999).</p><h5 id="graft-tension"><a href="#graft-tension" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Graft Tension</h5><p>Joint kinematics and in situ forces of the graft while the knee moves are considerably altered by the initial tension of the graft (Woo, et al., 2000). If the initial graft tension is low, there necessary joint stability will not be provided (Woo, et al., 2000). Conversely, high initial graft tension would hinder joint motion (Woo, et al., 2000). The initial tension is suggested near 44N but this is controversial since the native ACL force is unknown (Woo, et al., 2000)</p><h5 id="problem"><a href="#problem" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Problem</h5><p>Currently, surgeons must rely on their own strength to add tension to the ACL graft prior to fixing the graft. Once the graft is fixed, there is no way to add more tension if it is needed. Since surgeons must individually tension each graft, there is a lot of variance between graft tensions across all ACL reconstruction patients. Furthermore, over time, the graft naturally loses tension with patient usage. There is no method to re-tension a graft other than performing a new ACL surgery.</p><h5 id="our-device"><a href="#our-device" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Our Device</h5><p>The TensiFixTM fixation device allows the surgeon to fix a graft at both ends, and then add more tension on the femoral side. When the graft loosens over time, a patient can choose a minor surgery where the surgeon goes back to the original graft and tighten TensiFixTM, thus adding more tensions without performing another major surgery.</p><div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-8 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/acl_pic/screw_cross_section.jpg">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/acl_pic/screw_exploded.png">\n    </div>\n</div><div><a name="inovation"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="inovation">Innovation</h3><p>Post surgically, ACL grafts have been seen to lose tension due to normal cyclic loads applied during rehabilitation (Singhal, et.al, 2005). As the tension in the graft decreases, the knee’s ability to translate anteriorly increases; an occurrence meant to be minimized by the ACL reconstructive surgery (Grover, et. al, 2005). With current fixation techniques, the amount of tension in the graft immediately after surgery is dependent on that which the surgeon can provide in the tibial fixation. With our device, the surgeon is able to add additional tension to the graft at the femoral site after both ends of the graft are fixed.</p><div><a name="impact"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="impact">Impact</h3><p>TensiFixTM’s surgical importance lies in its ability to allow the adjustment of the graft after it has already been fixed in place. Currently, ACL reconstruction grafts are tensioned by manually pulling on the graft before fixation (Fu, Cohen 2006). This method can have many pitfalls. For example, variability in graft tension is associated with manual tensioning, as manual methods have been proven to be irreproducible from patient to patient (O’Neill, et al 2011). Also, fixation after tensioning limits the surgeon’s inability to further tension the graft if need arises. Thus, if the graft were to either not have enough tension initially or lose tension over time due to factors such as lengthening due to cyclic loading, the surgeon would have to redo the reconstruction to add tension to the graft (Harvey, et al. 2005). TensiFixTM functions like a regular Endobutton, allowing the surgeon to manually tension and fix the graft using the current manual method. However, should the fixed graft somehow lose tension, TensiFixTM’s tensioning screw can be backed out of its barrel, re-tensioning the graft. Thus, the surgeon is not forced to redo the entire reconstruction to tension the graft.</p><div><a name="sig"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="sig">Significance</h3><p>TensiFixTM is able to easily increase the tension during the ACL reconstruction. It addresses the need for a reliable way to increase the tension in knee ligament reconstruction surgeries. It uses an adjustable barrel-screw mechanism that is capable of adding tension to an existing graft. The TensiFixTM consists of three components: an externally threaded suture retainer, an internally threaded hexagonal barrel and a flat button retainer.</p><div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/acl_pic/insertion_cropped.png">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-8 columns">\n        <p>\n        The device comes pre-assembled before being implanted. The surgeon will thread a suture through the hexagonal hole in the flat button and though the externally and internally threaded barrel. The suture is then attached through the hole for each component. The barrel will come pre-assembled in the lowest position possible to allow for the greatest range of tension to be applied. The suture is then looped through a double bundle graft.<div>The device with the graft attached to it will be pulled through the end of the femoral tunnel and mounted at the end of the tunnel. The surgeon then places the barrel/retainer assembly into the hexagonal button and the graft is threaded through a femoral tunnel similar to the currently used EndoButton procedure. The TensiFixTM is then screwed out. It has the added benefit of being able to be adjusted post operatively. This allows surgeons to increase the graft tension in a quick and measurable way.\n</p>\n</div></div></div><ul class="small-block-grid-2">\n    <li><img class="th" src="./images/acl_pic/flattening_cropped.png"></li>\n    <li><img class="th" src="./images/acl_pic/tightening_cropped.png"></li>\n</ul></div>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/undergrad/tensiflex/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:4,frontmatter:{date:"2013-04-29T21:46:56.000Z",tags:["undergraduate","BME"],title:"Alternative ACL Fixation Device"},fields:{slug:"/undergrad/tensiflex/"}}],hardware:[{excerpt:"Background From the fall semester, in summary, we learned that: Grip force measurements from current devices, such as hand-held dynamometers, are poorly correlated with patients’ gripping performance during functional tasks, e.g. grabbing a can of…",html:'<h3 id="background"><a href="#background" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Background</h3>\n<p>From the fall semester, in summary, we learned that:</p>\n<p>Grip force measurements from current devices, such as hand-held dynamometers, are poorly correlated with patients’ gripping performance during functional tasks, e.g. grabbing a can of soda. These devices are unfamiliar to patients, can’t measure the five major types of grip, and lack the diagnostic resolution of a force distribution. Therefore, Improved assessment of patients’ gripping ability is necessary to identify the efficacy of treatments for grip-related disabilities.</p>\n<p>This translates well into the current market:</p>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="small-12 columns">\n        \n  <a class="gatsby-resp-image-link" href="/static/market-a79698420fa7f8439467932e9320a9fe-35896.png" style="display: block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">\n  \n  <span class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper" style="position: relative;

measurements from current devices, such as hand-held dynamometers, are poorly correlated with patients’ gripping performance during functional tasks, e.g. grabbing a can of soda. These devices are unfamiliar to patients, can’t measure the five major types of grip, and lack the diagnostic resolution of a force distribution. Therefore, Improved assessment of patients’ gripping ability is necessary to identify the efficacy of treatments for grip-related disabilities.</p>\n<p>This translates well into the current market:</p>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="small-12 columns">\n        \n  <a class="gatsby-resp-image-link" href="/static/market-a79698420fa7f8439467932e9320a9fe-35896.png" style="display: block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">\n  \n  <span class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper" style="position: relative;

Through this guide, students will be able to successfully perform a variety of tasks, the broader of which are to browse through prospective courses, plan a course schedule, register for classes, and manage a wait list. The document also includes advanced tips that are not very well known, but which can make the process much easier to complete. To effectively fulfill the purpose, our document was written in such a way as to provide users with the appropriate amount of detail regarding the different steps in the process. It was also important for us to mention all the various sections and steps in the entire process, regardless of how minor they may seem, in order to ensure a wide and well covered scope. At the same time, our written content was supported by strong visuals that further helped students to understand and complete the different steps in the process. </p><h4 id="audience"><a href="#audience" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Audience</h4><p>The main audience of our document will be the new students of the CMU community, namely the Freshman, Graduate, or transfer students, who wish to learn how to complete the Registration process through SIO. These students, who are new to the university, will have no prior experience with the process, and will thus require the use of an efficient instruction manual or guide. On the other hand, our minor audience will be current Carnegie Mellon University students who have made a schedule on SIO before, but who need a refresher, or who wish to learn more about the advanced features. However, some of these students may not necessarily have much prior knowledge and experience with the process, especially the upperclassmen, as the process underwent a recent change. The minor audience will include rising Sophomores, Juniors, Seniors and Graduate students. </p><p>Due to the lack of prior knowledge and experience our main audience has with the process, our document was written in great detail, in order to ensure the users gain a full and thorough understanding of the document. Not only this, however, but the level of detail will act as a strong support to the completion of the process, and will remove the possibility of struggle from the process. This was strengthened through the incorporation of relevant visuals to the document. For the more difficult steps in the process, users will be able to refer to the visuals in order to gain a better understanding. Our document design choices also took into consideration the level of experience of both audiences. Our visuals were always positioned on either the left hand side of the page or below the text, and thus helped to develop a schema that the users could easily follow. Moreover, the close proximity between the visuals and the relevant steps helped to further facilitate the users understanding of the document. </p><p>The way in which we separated the document, into not only three major sections, but also several sub-sections within each one of the three, was suitable for both the main and minor target audiences. For the new CMU students (the main audience), the incorporation of major and sub sections will help them to better navigate through the document as they are completing the registration process. They could also easily return to relevant section within the document through the on-going registration process. For the current CMU students (the minor audience), the incorporation of these sections along with a detailed contents page will allow them to easily turn to the specific area that they need a refresher of. For example, a current student who is referring to the manual for the sole purpose of learning about the advanced features will be able to determine the relevant page number and turn to the relevant page through the use of the contents page. This will eliminate the need for the student to go through the document page by page until the relevant section is found. </p><h4 id="context"><a href="#context" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Context</h4><p>Our audience will use the document towards the end of the current semester, or before the start of the prospective semester, in order to complete the registration process as a whole. This document is intended to be used constantly and over an extended period, rather than at once or in one sitting. This is due to the nature of the registration process, which is one that is on-going. As a result, it is intended that the first section of the process, the Course Schedule Plan Instructions, to be used a reasonable amount of time prior to the date of registration. Once the course schedule planning is complete, the document will not be referred to until the day of registration. At that point in time, the second section, Registration Process Instructions, will be referred to. Once the registration process is complete, students may either immediately use the third section, Waitlist Process Instructions, if they have a need to, or will refer to it only when the time comes for them to confirm their waitlist courses. On the other hand, students who have not been waitlisted for any of their planned courses will not need to refer to the third section of the document at all. </p><p>Given the context, we have written and designed the document in such a way as to explicitly divide the three relevant stages of the registration process into three separate process instruction sections. This will allow the users to easily refer to the appropriate section for each appropriate stage, and to easily navigate through the document as a whole. </p><div><a name="strat"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="strat">Strategies</h3><h4 id="genre-based-choices"><a href="#genre-based-choices" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Genre-based Choices</h4><p>Procedural writing should follow a set of conventions and techniques that, when combined, will create an effective document that will be well understood by the end-users. For our document, we used the conventions and techniques mentioned within Graves and Graves ‘Writing how-to documents’ to create an effective and efficient instructional document. </p><p>It is extremely important to know and understand your target audience in order to effectively create a document that is tailored to their needs and level of experience, as can be understood through Graves and Graves. As mentioned earlier, the level of detail in our document, as well as the content and design choices, were all made in regards to the level of experience and knowledge of our audiences.\nAt the beginning of the document, we included an introduction that provided the users with an initial understanding of what to expect from the document. At the same time, the contents page allowed us to present not only the subdivision of the processes, but also acted as an overview of the content and of the included material. As a result, our users will be able to make a decision as to whether or not the document will satisfy their needs, as well as an understanding of what is to be covered. For our minor target audience, the introduction and the overview will help them to determine if the stage they are looking to refresh or learn about is present, and on which page it could be located. The subdivision of processes also helps both the main and minor audiences to easily navigate through, and come back to, the document at any point in time. At the same time, we were able to incorporate Markel’s ‘Designing Documents’ conventions. For the overview and the contents page, we included accessing tools that facilitate the navigation through the document. The use of numbers and colors allowed us to benefited both us and the audience, as we were able to better organize the document in such a way as to make it easier for the users to navigate.</p><p>We made sure to follow the convention of writing usable steps, wherein we wrote the steps in chronological order for both the major sections and the sub-sections and in the imperative. We also made sure to limit one action per step, so as to make the process smoother and easier for the user to follow. Both of these suggestions can be found within ‘Writing how-to documents’. At the same time, we followed Markel’s conventions, most prominently chunking and accessing tools. Through the use of chunking, we were able to group and organize relevant tasks within the various sections, a factor that also allowed us to more easily subdivide. Through this, we were also able to incorporate accessing tools, such as the use of headers and footers, that made the document more informative and descriptive.\t</p><p>Through the use of screenshots, we were able to easily illustrate the various steps in more detail, as was recommended by Graves and Graves.

Since we do not know more about our audience then this general fact, it is important that we make a manual that appeals to all types of learners in the audience. </p><p>We decided to write very clear, and sometimes even incredibly obvious instructions, so that even a person who has horrible intuition when it comes to using SIO could follow our instructions and learn how to design a schedule. In our manual we tell our audience members the exact name of each button they must click, the approximate location of each button, and even include a picture of said button. We feel that this is the only way to ensure that our instructions do not appear vague to any audience member. The general instructions that come with SIO for how to design a schedule do not go into much detail, and thus can be quite unhelpful if a particular student needs very concrete instructions. We wanted our guide to stick out from previous Course Schedule Planner instructions, especially the ones located to the side of a sample schedule that are provided by SIO, and writing incredibly detailed instructions seemed to be the best way to do so.</p><p>We also wished our manual to include lots of visual instructions. In fact if a student simply follows the instructions outlined in our visuals, they could learn to use the Course Schedule Planner without reading the bulk of our written instructions. This is because many audience members might be visual learners, who prefer picture based instructions to written instructions. Students also get a better understand of the location of certain tabs, buttons, and drop-down menus from our visuals than they do from our written instructions. Thus our visuals really help to support our written text, as outlined in Horton &#x26; Horton’s “Picture Perfect Proposals”. Finally our visuals also help the text appear to be less dense and easier to read, and thus improve the overall readability and appeal of our manual. This is an application of Redish’s mixing modes technique. This is because our audience will be unlikely to use our document if it is more confusing than the currently existing instructions on SIO.  </p><h4 id="adaptation-strategies"><a href="#adaptation-strategies" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Adaptation Strategies</h4><p>A good manual provides an explicit schema for the tasks we wish for the audience to accomplish. We employed Smith and Goodman’s linear elaboration technique, as we had a very brief introduction in each section immediately followed by our instructions. We did this because we wanted our manual to be to the point. This is because our manual is primarily a reading to learn to do document. According to Redish these types of documents must be quick and serve an immediate purpose as the audience members want to get to the “doing” part as quickly as possible. We did not want a verbose introduction to each section as we felt the primary goal of our manual is to give the audience a short but incredibly detailed guide for using the Course Schedule Planner. We did not want the audience to waste any time reading a watered down version of our instructions before they got to our actual instructions. </p><p>We also wanted each set of instructions for a particular feature of the Course Schedule plan to be consistent to avoid confusing our audience. Thus each section had a small flowchart detailing what the section was going to talk about, a small written introduction, and a numbered list of action steps. Even though three different people worked on this manual we had all agreed to this general style beforehand, as we wanted the manual to read as if it had been written and designed by one collective mind instead of three disjoint minds. This was based on Redish’s principle of coherence and consistency. Also to aid with the readability of the document we used a consistent font style, used appropriate font changes to highlight section headings/information we wanted to stick out, and we also employed a serif typeface.</p><p>Finally we employed a table of contents in an attempt to help guide those looking for a specific piece of information to the right page in our manual. Since some of our audience members might only need a small refresher on a particular part of the Course Schedule Planner, we wanted our guide to be able to direct people to the appropriate pages without them having to skim through the entire document first. </p><div><a name="design"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="design">Design Choices</h3><p>The document was designed considering student’s context when registering or preparing to register. Generally, students are working at a desk with their laptop, either at home or some place on campus, when registering for classes. Therefore, they will be juggling one screen of information, their laptop, while also looking at the instruction booklet for registering. To accommodate this, as suggested by Graves and Graves, a smaller page size for the booklet was chosen. The 8.5x5.5” format provides this smaller, more manageable size, as well as a enough space for additional graphics that help to adapt the written information. Additionally, this format is both more easily distributed, and perceived as more of a helpful booklet, rather than an instruction manual. From CMU’s perspective, the booklet should be approachable by students and not appear to be a daunting instruction manual with regards to registration. This would make the registration process seem very complicated and something a student wouldn’t be able to do without assistance. </p><p>Looking inside the booklet, rather than considering pages to be individual entities, sections rely on the pages being viewed as a two-page spread. Individuals using the book will most likely have it lay flat on a desk for easy viewing, or on top of the keyboard of their laptop (which is well supported by the smaller height of the booklet). Instructions begin on the leftmost page, and the second, rightmost page either continues the instructions on it, with pictures being mixed in along the way, or it provides an overview graphic of the screen/task they are to be accomplishing. </p><p>A 3 column layout is used throughout the document, aside from the title page, which uses a 6 column layout. The 3 column layout allows for a variety of graphics, from entire screen shots, to small menu shots with accompanying text. Additionally, it creates room for the notations attached to the images. These notations add context to the images, essential for understanding their relationship to the written instructions. </p><p>The larger sections of the document are placed on the rightmost page of the spread, enabling a person who is quickly paging through the book to immediately find the section they are looking for without having to glance over to the back of the previous page. Additionally, this provides extra separation from previous sections, which helps to emphasize the difference between the various task sections. With the table of contents and the page numbers that are featured at the top of every page, browsing of the booklet is fairly efficient: individuals can use the page numbers to quickly find their position in the book, and then the individual sections are separated enough to stand out. </p></div>',

During testing, the patient will be asked to perform certain motions utilizing one of the objects, to test for his/her ability to perform similar tasks involving the same kind of grip force. In a test, the soda can-shaped object would be placed on a table while the patient, sitting in a chair in front of the object, would be asked to grasp it, retrieve it, and deliver it to himself as if he were to drink soda from a can.</p>\n<h5 id="data-acquisition"><a href="#data-acquisition" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Data Acquisition</h5>\n<p>While the test object is being handled by the patient, the embedded sensors will continuously register the force that is being applied.

An analytical commentary on the problems inherent in social structures, with particular emphasis placed on capitalism, the manifesto was commissioned by the Communist Party and serves as the basis for the communist movement that grew out of the nineteenth century.  What followed was an ideological split between followers and proponents of individualistic social structure (capitalism) and more community-oriented social structures, like those proposed in communism.  </p><p>This ideological shift served as the basis for our project.  We wanted to examine whether the changes in political and social thought were borne out in the language and lexicon used in the time period surrounding the publication of “The Communist Manifesto”.  Several research questions were of particular interest to us: do words identified as ‘communal’ words have similar patterns of frequency over our given time period? Do the ‘individualistic’ words?  We also would like to compare some data specific to “The Communist Manifesto” to our general dataset.</p><p>We expected to see several trends in the data that we analyzed.  As the ideological shift we  focused on involved an emphasis on group-mentality and social organization, we expected to see an increase in the frequency of the usage of words that we identified as being ‘communal’.  As the population became more aware of the ideas presented within the manifesto and inherent in communism, there would logically be a greater usage of terms related to those ideas.  Conversely, we hypothesized that there might be a slight decrease in the frequency usage of more ‘individualistic’ terms.  We treated ‘communal’ and ‘individualistic’ as antonyms, and as such, predicted an increase in one to suggest a decrease in the other. Additionally, we expected to see a correlation between like terms, in regards to plurality;  we anticipated seeing clusters, based on the pattern of frequency over time, of words we deemed to be ‘communal’ and ‘individualistic’ </p><p>Our project was two-pronged in nature, with a digital component and a humanistic analysis.  As outlined below, we needed to construct a digital tool capable of clustering the data that was of interest.  The tool produced a computational analysis of our primary source of data, the google Ngram corpus.  The tool returned data on the frequency of words used over our time period, 1840-1860, and clusters words that have similar usage frequency.  This data was then looked at through a humanistic lens, where we provided sociocultural explanations for the data and explored the limitations and biases of our project.</p><div><a name="related"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="related">Related Work</h3><p>In 2012, Jean Twenge, M. Keith Campbell, and Brittany Gentile published an article that included two studies they conducted on the usage of individualistic and communal terms.  Their studies focused on a perceived increase in use of individual-centric words and phrases between 1960 and 2008.  Like the analysis presented below, they are interested in examining the influence culture has on language.  They use a large corpus of book data that has been digitized as their primary source. They eventually conclude that the increase in individualistic words and phrases demonstrates a cultural shift toward American individualism in the second half of the twentieth century.  This article, and Twenge et al.’s work have been criticized for failing to account for specific events that happen within the time period that might alter language change.  Our project, in comparison, centers around a particular event in history, looking for language change that may be related to that event.\nIn our research, we turned to a fair amount of existing work that investigates the relationship of language to Marxism. In many of the studies we came across, social class became the primary concern, with a focus on the veiling effect of specific language. This is related to the expression of distinct ideas by a certain social class within a larger national language. An example is Valentinin Voloshiov’s “Marxism and the Philosophy of Language”, which deals with how ideologies shape language. Another reference point is “Marxist Linguistic Theory and Communist Practice: A Sociolinguistic Study” by Max K. Adler, in which language is thought of as a product of society, and society as a product of language. If this is indeed the case, we would expect to see such forces at work within our Ngram data.</p><p>Another way that our research is distinct from existing work, is that we seek to quantify the changes that occur within language and ideologies after the publication of “The Communist Manifesto”. By tracking the rise or decline in particular language, we expect to make visible the linguistic trends that may coincide with historical events.</p><div><a name="method"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="method">Methodology</h3><p>Do to computational limitations, the tool was designed to output data relating to the top 25,000 most frequently used 1-grams in the general English corpus from 1840-1860. To do this, we filtered through the time-series information for all of the 1-grams in the corpus and sorted them by their maximum volume count. Therefore, a word was considered to be in the top 25,000 only if it was featured in a variety of writings. Unfortunately, we were unable to normalize words based on their relative frequency, due to the floating point limitation of the double data type e.g. the numbers were too small to compute. </p><p>After the preprocessing, we decided to utilize the K-medoids clustering algorithms to cluster words that have similar time series. For our K-medoids distance function, rather than using standard euclidean distance, we decided to use Pearson’s product correlation coefficient. Pearson’s correlation controls for different locations and scales of the two time series, which was useful to us so we could account for the base-usage of a word (the location), and the response a related word would have (the scale). Ideally, using this distance function allowed us to detect a larger selection of correlated words, rather than just those with a high euclidean similarity. Initially we were planning on utilizing K-means as our clustering method, however it did not end up performing well using Pearson’s correlation as a distance function. The cluster assignment and centroid update function did not end up converging, therefore the algorithm never truly ran correctly. K-medoids, which can handle arbitrary distance functions, ended up being a better fit for us.</p><p>We used the Java-ML implementation of the algorithm, due to its high regard in the community and its availability. We ran the algorithm 10 times, with a maximum of 1000 clusters for each run and at least 100 iterations of the algorithm. We took the 10 runs of the algorithm and calculated the sum of centroid similarities for each run. The run with the highest sum of similarities was then taken as the final set of clusters. The resulting set of clusters were exported and then used in a custom-made view. The view allows for an individual to search for a word, view the other words clustered with it, view the time-series for each word and view the average time-series of the individual time-series. </p><p>Following the production of the digital clustering tool, we input our lists of ‘individualistic’ and ‘communal’ words.  As a note, these word lists are primarily taken from a previous study on plurality performed by Twenge, Campbell, and Gentile in 2012.  Twenge’s study also focused on examining the distinction between plural and individualistic words and language’s relation to culture.  We used their word lists as the basis for our own, modifying them slightly to be more applicable to our specific project and time period of study.  In inputting the words, we were interested in which words the tool identified as belonging to the same cluster, as well as the frequency curve associated with each cluster.  The frequency curves can be produced by taking the numeric data that the tool outputs for each clustered word and inserting it into a basic Microsoft excel file and making a line chart.  Examples of frequency charts can be found in Appendix C.   The input words and the words they clustered with can be found in Appendix B.</p><p>We looked at Twenge’s study again when considering what methods might be potentially effective. For instance, Twenge made use of Mechanical Turk to have participants rate words on a scale from most ‘individualistic’ to most ‘communal’. Crowdsourcing can certainly be an effective tool for dealing with subtle or subjective questions. However, our system of clustering avoids such arbitrary rating systems and provides us with much more data driven results.</p><p>We also used Wheaton College’s online Lexos analysis tool to identify the top 50 words used in the Communist Manifesto. After removing common English stopwords, the resulting wordcloud served as a starting point for us to begin testing our clustering tool.</p><div><a name="results"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="results">Results</h3><p>We have represented our results visually in the appendices at the end of this paper.  The first appendix outlines the thirty words, fifteen ‘individualistic’ and fifteen ‘communal’, that would wanted to closely examine.  The second appendix consists of a table which displays each of the thirty words that we input into the clustering tool and the resulting cluster of words that the tool identified as having similar frequency patterns.  The third, and final, appendix has a sample of the line graphs associated with the selected words.<br>\nUpon closer analysis, several interesting results were apparent.  Of the fifteen ‘individualistic’ words that we identified in our word lists fourteen returned clusters; “Uniqueness” was not in the top 25,000 most frequent words in the Ngram data and did not return a cluster.  Of the fifteen ‘communal’ words, only eleven returned clusters; the inputs “communal”, “communitarian”, “socialism”, and “collectivism” did not return clusters.  Also, the average size of an ‘individualistic’ cluster was 65.286 words.  The average size of a ‘communal’ cluster was 46.545.  The averages were determined by summing up the total words in one of the two categories and dividing by the number of terms that output clusters.  (See Appendix B)</p><p>In terms of upward or downward tendencies, all of the graphs produced using the numerical data for each clustered word show an increase over time.  That is, the average line graph of each cluster increases over the time period.  We did not see any decreasing graphs.  (See Appendix C)</p><div><a name="discuss"></a></div><h3 data-magellan-destination="discuss">Discussion</h3><p>The quantitative data that was output by the digital tool served as the basis for further analysis.  Below, we explore our research questions in relation to the data, discuss assumptions that we made in our project, outline biases of our project, and propose implications for future research. </p><p>Our hypothesis regarding the increase of plural term usage over the period from 1840-1860 was, in part, based on the assumption that words with similar meanings would have similar frequency graphs.  In using the clustering tool, we hoped to see these frequency clusters of semantically-related terms.  Specifically, we hoped to see ‘communal’ words clustered with other ‘communal’ words, indicating that they followed similar frequency patterns.  We expected the frequency patterns of such clusters to increase over the course of our chosen time period. Such a result would provide some support for our hypothesis that there was a shift in ideology, a move toward a more group-oriented frame of thought, that was evident in the lexicon.   </p><p>Our results however, did not display clusters that were as semantically-connected as we had predicted.  Some words did tend to cluster with like words, but many of our sample words produced clusters that were wide-ranging with no apparent semantic link (see appendix B).</p><p>With the knowledge that the graphs produced by inputting the numerical data about word frequencies into Excel covered more semantic territory than just ‘communal’ or ‘individualistic’ words, we still thought there might be value in looking at more general upward and downward trends across the data.  All of the graphs we produced from the data display an increase.  This increase is the result of the tool outputting the raw data on the frequency of the words themselves, which will naturally increase over time.  In order to actually look at the increase or decrease of specific words without interference, we would need to have relative frequencies for the terms.  Unfortunately, due to computational limitations, the relative frequencies would be too small analyze.  We would need to recompute the relative frequencies and graph those, and unfortunately we did not have time to do so. Therefore, we were unable to reach concrete conclusions about increase or decrease in our two categories. </p><p>In our effort to examine the direct influence of a single text, we also pulled out the most frequent words in The Communist Manifesto, in hopes of comparing their frequencies over the time period in question.  Unfortunately, many of the words that were used extensively in Marx’s text were not among the top 25,000 words identified in the Ngram data.  Words like ‘proletariat’ and ‘bourgeoisie’, that are integral to the manifesto and to the ideology underlying the text, are not present. Thus, we were unable to track the use of the words and their frequencies.  This suggests that these words were not largely in use in the time period we examined. </p><p>In fact, it may be the case that the Communist Manifesto simply was not as influential as we would have expected, given the emphasis modern society places on the text.  Our data suggests, though not empirically, that the manifesto’s impact on the overall lexicon from 1840-1860 was limited, if present at all.   We were not able to attribute any specific lexical change to the manifesto itself.  </p><p>While the scope of our project and results was not such that we can make any claims on whether the publication of The Communist Manifesto impacted the lexicon of the time period that we examined, we can explore other implications of the data.  As mentioned above, the Communist Manifesto uses highly specific language, meaning that many of its most crucial terms do not show up in the most common language of the time we investigated. This being the case, it became an interesting question for us to consider what terms might be most revealing about the culture of this period. For instance, if we look at the word ‘industrial’, which does show up in the top 50 words of the Communist Manifesto, we see that its usage follows a similar change over time as the word ‘atheism’. While this could be significant, even obvious, let us also consider that ‘industrial’ clusters with such words as ‘accidents’, ‘blinds’, ‘successes’, and ‘villages’. Some of these clusters seem predictable, others seem to reveal more subtle connections, and still others seem arbitrary or difficult to draw meaning from. For future work, perhaps additional methods can be implemented in order to aid in interpretation</p><p>A possible bias of our data comes from the fact that the English publication date of the Communist Manifesto (1950) is situated squarely within the time period we investigated (1840-1860). We chose this time frame because it allowed us to not only examine the forces at work leading up to the manifesto, but also those immediately following its publication. However, this is perhaps too limited a time period, as we suspect that the linguistic impact of the manifesto might not be noticeable until much later than 1860.\nOne possible implication of our study is that the impact of any single culturally significant literary work, be it the Communist Manifesto, The Wealth of Nations, or any other work, is far less immediate and apparent than what might be expected. Thus, it might be necessary to investigate linguistic data at a much larger scope.  </p><p>For example, looking at parts of speech might reveal even more.  An interesting result that we noted during the examination of our data was that nouns tended to cluster with words that were more easily identifiable as being related by meaning.  Other parts of speech, like adjectives and adverbs, produced more scattered results.  Words that had both a noun form and an adjective form also did not produce very clear clusters.  For example, the word ‘individual’, which can be both a noun or a descriptive adjective, clustered with words that ranged from other adjectives (adequate, comprehensive), verbs (deducing, eject) and other nouns.  The nouns that clustered with individual (art, auxiliary, compulsion, fete, handmaid, individual, nicety, serpents, species, superstructure, sweets, uncertainty, veracity) ranged from concepts to tangible objects and, arguably, included more words related to ‘communal’ ideas than ‘individual’ ones. </p><p>Additionally, a closer examination of the words in each cluster could add depth to the analysis.  For example, it might be worthwhile to look at the positivity or negativity of the words that cluster together.  Coding words as negative or positive could give more insight into ideological change over time.  It might be the case that words with similar positive or negative connotations group together.  We noted that a large number of words that are traditionally perceived as negative appeared in the clusters of the ‘individualistic’ terms.  For example, the word “independent” clusters with “abandon”, “conflicting”, “confusion”, “danger”, “destroying”, and “difficulties”.  It should be noted that positive words also appear in the cluster, but to a lesser degree.  Exploring this tendency in future research might lead to interesting conclusions. </p><p>Overall, this project resulted in the production of a digital tool that has wide-ranging applications.  While we discovered that its use in exploring a singular text, in this case “The Communist Manifesto”, as indicative of larger social context may not always be possible, it is at our disposal for future research.  Ideally, we could now apply this tool to a larger variety of questions with more concrete foundations and more correct parameters of interest. </p></div>',

The Android application I created is an extension of this — it allows you to view any information you normally see through the web application on your phone. It does this by connecting to our Ruby on Rails server through an API I created to pair with the Android application. After using a token for authentication, users can view information about a room, including power consumption and sensor graphs, as well as control the room’s lights. As an extra feature, the application can detect with a user is in a room by using a Bluetooth LE beacon. </p>\n<img class="th" src="./images/greenlight_mobile/Greenlight_Mobile.002.png">\n<div><a name="architecture"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="architecture">Architecture</h3>\n<img class="th" src="./images/greenlight_mobile/Greenlight_Mobile.004.png">\n<p>The app utilizes two core components of the Android framework to manage its connection to the Ruby on Rails application. For authentication, Android’s AbstactAccountAuthenticator class was implemented to allow for a more structured authentication process. This allows a user’s\n<a href="/portfolio/greenlight.html">Greenlight</a> account to appear in the general settings screen, and allow for background Bluetooth scanning preferences to be adjusted. </p>\n<p>For actually transmitting and receiving data, a custom content provider and cursor were implemented. The content provider utilizes a local caching SQLite database to reduce requests to the database. The content provider accepts rails-esque queries - so you can send, for example: </p>\n<p><code class="language-text">where(&#39;id = 5&#39;).order_by(:updated_at)</code></p>\n<p>Additionally the content provider allows you to follow rails associations, so most of the requeries are done for you. </p>\n<div><a name="bluetooth"></a></div>\n<h3 data-magellan-destination="bluetooth">Proximity Sensor</h3>\n<img class="th" src="./images/greenlight_mobile/Greenlight_Mobile.005.png">\n<p>The proximity detection portion of the application was created using a Bluetooth LE beacon. I used the <a href="http://redbearlab.com/blemini/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ReadBearLabs BLE Mini</a> and flashed a custom firmware image onto it. The firmware image implemented the Apple iBeacon protocol. This has 4 parts to it: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Proximity ID - used to identify the <a href="/portfolio/greenlight.html">Greenlight</a> Beacon</li>\n<li>Major Version - used to identify the room</li>\n<li>Minor Version - used to identify the dimmer in the room</li>\n<li>RSSI - the signal strength information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Android application uses the <a href="http://developer.radiusnetworks.com/ibeacon/android/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">RadiusNetworks iBeacon library</a> to scan for the iBeacon. On bootup of the phone, a background service is started that attaches to the library and scans for broadcasts in the background. Once a broadcast is received, the phone creates a notification, informing the user that a greenlight system is nearby, and when selected, takes them to the appropriate room screen within the application.</p>\n<p>On average, the background scanning only reduced battery life by about 1 hour, and it is expected to improve with time. The low energy scanning implemented in Android is, at this point, only supposed to happen at discrete times, rather than constantly, however this constant scanning should hopefully become core in the future. </p>',id:"/Users/nhahn/Research/PersonalSite/src/pages/undergrad/greenlight-mobile/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:2,frontmatter:{date:"2013-12-01T21:46:56.000Z",tags:["undergraduate","IS","software","Android"],title:"Greenlight - Mobile"},fields:{slug:"/undergrad/greenlight-mobile/"}},{excerpt:"Introduction Maintenaid is a software program that will be designed for maintenance workers.

Most large industrial parks and university campuses rely solely on artificial sources to provide light for their rooms. Artificial light at these locations is often emitted in excess of what is necessary in an indoor space. This excess represents an entirely preventable waste of energy. Windows in these rooms offer an abundance of natural light during the day and this can help brighten a room. However, the artificial lights are usually on at full power whether the sun is shining bright or hiding behind the clouds. </p>\n<ul class="small-block-grid-3">\n    <li><img class="th" src="./images/greenlight/intro_1.png"></li>\n    <li><img class="th" src="./images/greenlight/intro_2.png"></li>\n    <li><img class="th" src="./images/greenlight/intro_3.png"></li>\n</ul>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-8 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/greenlight/greenlight_intro.jpg">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n    <p>Our group has set out to solve this problem by developing an information system that automates artificial light sources to enhance comfort and reduce energy consumption. This system will dim the artificial lights when the sunlight entering the room is brighter. As the sunlight in the room decreases, the artificial lights in the room will brighten, compensating for this loss of natural light.

Most large industrial parks and university campuses rely solely on artificial sources to provide light for their rooms. Artificial light at these locations is often emitted in excess of what is necessary in an indoor space. This excess represents an entirely preventable waste of energy. Windows in these rooms offer an abundance of natural light during the day and this can help brighten a room. However, the artificial lights are usually on at full power whether the sun is shining bright or hiding behind the clouds. </p>\n<ul class="small-block-grid-3">\n    <li><img class="th" src="./images/greenlight/intro_1.png"></li>\n    <li><img class="th" src="./images/greenlight/intro_2.png"></li>\n    <li><img class="th" src="./images/greenlight/intro_3.png"></li>\n</ul>\n<div class="row">\n    <div class="medium-8 columns">\n        <img class="th" src="./images/greenlight/greenlight_intro.jpg">\n    </div>\n    <div class="medium-4 columns">\n    <p>Our group has set out to solve this problem by developing an information system that automates artificial light sources to enhance comfort and reduce energy consumption. This system will dim the artificial lights when the sunlight entering the room is brighter. As the sunlight in the room decreases, the artificial lights in the room will brighten, compensating for this loss of natural light.
